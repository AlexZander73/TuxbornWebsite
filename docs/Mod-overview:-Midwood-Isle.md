This is the overview page for Midwood Isle, one of the larger DLC-sized mods included in the Tuxborn load order.

## "What is this mod about?"

Midwood Isle centers around how a vengeful entity wants to destroy the Sonmer (the Sun Elves), and their home of Midwood Isle. And in so doing, use your body to proceed to wreak havoc on Tamriel.

As the Dragonborn, you will be tasked with stopping this vengeful entity, and saving Midwood Isle.

## "How do I start Midwood Isle?"

Midwood is one of the mods we're running that requires you to have finished The Way of the Voice, so first, you should do that.

Then, as soon as you hit level 10 and enter any city, you should be approached by a courier who'll bring you an unsigned letter asking you to meet a contact in Winterhold. Go to Winterhold and visit the Frozen Hearth inn. You'll find your contact there, in a group of green-robed worshippers.

## "What level is recommended to begin Midwood Isle?"

10 is the bare minimum. The mod creator recommends 20 or above, as per the mod's page on Nexus.

## "What followers are best to bring to Midwood Isle?"

None of our custom followers are known to have Midwood-specific commentary, so player's choice on what followers to bring.

## "Does Midwood Isle have any displayable LOTD artifacts?"

Not directly. There is an unofficial Midwood Isle patch for LOTD, but that is not included in our load order.

But that said, certain displayable items can drop on Midwood anyway. Ayleid weapons dropped from undead at Lisindril, an Ayleid ruin on the north shore of Midwood Isle, are normally artifacts from Beyond Skyrim: Bruma. If you get to Midwood before you get to Bruma, though, you may find Ayleid weapons for display this way.

You _will_ receive certain unique named items as part of running this mod. So you might put these in one of the Armory's side wings in the museum if you wish. Or, put them up on the various display locations in Freywyn Hall.

## "What kinds of weapons and armor are available in Midwood Isle?"

As per the mod's description, there are 11 new custom weapons and 3 new custom armor sets. A lot of these items are available as quest rewards for side quests.

None of Midwood's gear is known to be competitive with other mid-to-late game gear available in our load order. So whether you should consider using any of it is purely a matter of your personal preference. 

Also, none of the gear in Midwood is known to be craftable.

## "Does Midwood Isle have a player home?"

Yes. Freywyn Hall is the player home available to you on Midwood. It's similar to the Hearthfire houses in that you have to buy the land it sits on, and then do work to build it out. Like the Hearthfire houses, it has a carpenter's bench on site that you use to build out the various wings of it. It's slightly more expensive to buy the land for the house than it is to buy the land for the Hearthfire houses, 8,000 septims vs. 5,000.

The layout of the house is unique to it, which is neat. You will have choices as to how you build out the house. You may or may not wind up with all crafting stations, depending on which choices you make for the wings of the house. And you will not have a smelter at all, even though there will be a forge in the cellar. That said, it's only a short walk away to the nearest town, Florin, which does have a decent complement of merchants, including a blacksmith with a smelter. So the lack of one in the house may or may not be a dealbreaker for you.

You will be able to buy all critical building materials to work on the house from Sythin, the steward in Florin. 

If a home not actually physically in Skyrim does not appeal to you, its being located on Midwood may be a dealbreaker. On the upside, though, beachfront property! 🏖️

You will not be able to ask _most_ followers to live there, but any follower known to have custom capability for this can be invited to stay. So far, this includes Katana, Megara, Shale, Remiel, and Xelzaz.

Likewise, you cannot ask your family to settle there unless you have Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions in the load order, and Tuxborn's load order does not include that mod.

## "Are there any new followers in Midwood Isle?"

One: the Sonmer Tyrek. He is mostly there to be your contact during running the Midwood main quest. But at the end of it, if you decide you like him, he will be available to you as a permanent follower.

He is not known to be competitive with any of our major custom followers, though.

## "What other custom content is available in Midwood Isle?"

You can learn two new Shouts, nine new spells, and a new enchantment. There are also a variety of books unique to the mod, which explore the lore behind Midwood's settling, and the Sonmer people. If you're interested in that backstory, take the time to read those books.

There is a dragon priest with a mask you can acquire via one of Midwood's side quests.

There is a brand new Black Book, which is part of one of the quests you'll run when you reach the realm of Lastendell.

There is also a spirit horse you can ride, but he is available only while you are within Lastendell, and cannot generally be used in game.

## "What side quests are available in Midwood Isle?"

Midwood has a large number of side quests, and several of them have very generous loot, so it's worth your time to do them. If you want an advance look at what you might be in for, including the possible quest rewards, you can find a full list of them at the [Midwood isle page](https://tes-mods.fandom.com/wiki/Midwood_Isle) on the TES Mods wiki.

## "What are some other recommendations for running Midwood Isle?"

Once you have done your initial visit to Midwood, it'll be up to you how much of its content you play at once. Its main quest is fairly lengthy, as are several of its side quests. As with playing on Solstheim, at least one of those side quests will send you on an errand back to Skyrim! So you may find it worth your while to weave Midwood play in amongst doing other things, as your play preferences dictate.

Be advised that when you reach the point in Midwood's main quest where you need to use a shrine to go to Lastendell, you will be told that only you can use that shrine. You'll have the follower Tyrek at the time, and he'll stand down from following you. If you are running any other followers that use vanilla code, they will likely also auto-dismiss.

However, any custom followers you're running may well come with you regardless. This is known so far to occur with Auri, Remiel, and Xelzaz. So if you want to respect the Midwood quest expectation that you proceed to Lastendell alone, you should ask any custom followers to wait for you.

There is a point in Midwood's main quest where you will likely be exposed to Canis Hysteria, and two points while running one of its side quests. If you're not interested in being a werewolf, make sure you stock up on Cure Disease potions.

Last but not least, regarding fighting the final boss in Midwood's main quest:

<details>
<summary><i>Word of warning about fighting Zahkris...</i></summary>
<br>

When you reach the final fight with Zahkris, be sure to use all three words of the Steal Essence Shout on him, otherwise you will _not_ be able to damage him. This could prove problematic if you don't take him out quickly enough. He packs a powerful punch, and can kill you even if you're a fairly high level character. He may also be a major problem for any followers you're running who aren't Essential.

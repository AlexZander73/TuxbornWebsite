## "How do you start Wheels of Lull?"

Wheels of Lull will auto-start on you once you hit level 20, and enter any of the following locations:

* Dawnstar
* Dragon Bridge
* Falkreath
* Ivarstead
* Karthwasten
* Morthal
* Riverwood
* Rorikstead
* Shor's Stone
* Winterhold

You should see a popup message which will tell you that the world has "shifted". Shortly after, a strange individual called Millisecond Llavados will approach you, urge you to go rescue someone for treasure, and tell you to go to Stonehole Mine in the Pale. He'll also collapse, apparently dead, and you'll need to take a glowing object from his "corpse". The object will continue to speak to you in this character's voice.

## "Does Wheels of Lull have level requirements?"

As noted above, you have to be at least level 20 to launch the mod in general, and run the first stage of its main quest. The main quest has seven stages. Of the remaining six, three of those also have level requirements as follows:

* "The Mer in the High Castle": Level 25
* "The Brass Forest": Level 30
* "At the Bottom of the World": Level 35

Dialogue you get from a central NPC in this quest line sets up the idea of you going off and doing other things in between the quests in question. So if you happen to start Wheels of Lull at a later stage of your playthrough, this may be a bit of a bumpy narrative experience. So keep this in mind as you work out how you want to play through this mod, spacing it through your playthrough vs. playing straight through, however you prefer.

## "Does Wheels of Lull have displayable artifacts for the LOTD museum?"

Yes. Three dozen, in fact. You can find a list of all the displayable artifacts from this mod on the LOTD wiki page for the Hall of Lost Empires, in [its Wheels of Lull Display section](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Hall_of_Lost_Empires_(SSE)#Wheels_of_Lull_Display).

## "What kinds of weapons are available in Wheels of Lull?"

Several clockwork-themed melee weapons, and several clockwork-themed projectile weapons as well.

The most notable melee weapon is a Clockwork Sword. If you run a particular side quest to acquire dyes for its standard form, you can create alternate colored versions of this weapon, as well. All of the color variants are displayable in the museum, so if you're aiming to try to get as many displays in your museum as possible, then you'll want to run the side quest to get the dyes, [Dye Trader](https://tes-mods.fandom.com/wiki/Dye_Trader). Pro tip: you will need human hearts for this.

The projectile weapons are rifles, _not_ crossbows, even though they're tagged as crossbows in your inventory. These come in six different varieties. Avarri in Lull-Mor sells the standard harquebus, and as you progress through the Wheels of Lull quest line, Avarri will give you lists of the necessary materials to make the others. So it's useful to stop and talk to him in between the stages of the main Wheels of Lull quest.

Once you know what materials are required, you can bring those materials to Avarri to make the other types of harquebus. The Targetian Harquebus is potential loot as you run the quest line as well.

The harquebus variants include:

* [Standard Harquebus](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_Harquebus)
    * Sold by Avarri
* [Combative Harquebus](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Combatative_Harquebus)
    * Craftable by Avarri if you bring him the right materials
* [Targetian Harquebus](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Targetian_Harquebus)
    * Craftable by Avarri if you bring him the right materials
    * Can be found as loot in certain parts of the quest line
    * Potentially pickpocketable off of Lull-Mor guards, if you have the Perfect Touch perk in Security
    * Required to make some of the other forms of harquebus, so you'll need a total of four of them to fill all harqebus displays, or five if you want one to use yourself
* [Bombastic Harquebus](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Bombastic_Harquebus)
    * Craftable by Avarri if you bring him the right materials
* [Lullian Harquebus](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Lullian_Harquebus)
    * Craftable by Avarri if you bring him the right materials, including the Lullian Shield
* [Rotational Harquebus](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Rotational_Harquebus)
    * Craftable by Avarri if you bring him the right materials

Most of the harquebuses use Clockwork Shots as ammo. You can buy this ammo from Avarri, loot it off of dead Chronographer Guards, or, if you run the "Riddling Rails" side quest, you can acquire the Clockwork Shot Mold to make more ammo yourself. The mold will make three Clockwork Shots for every gold ingot you have in your inventory, so to take advantage of this, stock up on gold ingots.

#### ‼️ Important note about asking Avarri to craft the harquebuses for you ‼️

You need to make sure to have the instructions for making any harquebus you want Avarri to craft in your inventory in order for the dialogue option with Avarri to work correctly. So don't store the notes with the instructions anywhere until you've got all the weapons they describe made.

### More on the Lullian Harquebus

This one is the only harquebus that has a replica recipe in LOTD, and it's one of the ones that's only available when you have the original item in your inventory. You will definitely want to make a replica, if either of these two scenarios applies to you:

1. You want to keep and use the harquebus for yourself
2. You want to get Numinar's Dwemeri Cutting Sphere, and you don't want to or can't pickpocket it off of him, which leaves trading him the harquebus for the sphere as your only option

Note also that this one is the only one you don't actually need ammo for, because the Lullian Harquebus generates its own ammo. So if you're going to use any of them in regular play at all, this one might be the best candidate. But be sure to familiarize yourself with the others as well, just to see if any of them do things that sound more fun and/or useful to you.

### More on the Dwemeri Cutting Sphere

This item is only available from Numinar, one of the primary NPCs in the mod. And you have only two ways of getting it from him:

1. Trade the Lullian Harquebus to him for it (in which case, you should make a replica before you talk to Numinar, so you can still display the replica)
2. Pickpocket it off of him, which will require you to have a Security skill of 100 and the Perfect Touch perk

## "What kinds of armor are available in Wheels of Lull?"

There is an entire set of Chronographer gear available, and other unique pieces as well. Almost all of these are displayable in the museum.

The main ones that are plot-relevant are the Magnusian Visor and the Lullian Shield.

The Lullian Shield is required to make the Lullian Harquebus, and it will be destroyed in the process. So you should be sure to make a replica of the shield in your LOTD museum _before_ you make that weapon. The replica recipe is available only while the original is in your inventory.

## "Can I craft the armor and weapons available in Wheels of Lull?"

No, but you can temper the items you're interested in using, vs. just displaying in the LOTD museum. To do this, you will need to read the Clockwork Smithing book that's on the table in the middle of the Lull-Mor smithery. This will unlock the relevant perk to allow you to temper the items.

Also, to temper the items, you will need [Technomantic Ingots](https://trainwiz.fandom.com/wiki/Technomantic_Ingot). This provided link has info on where you can actually get those. You won't be able to make them, but there are some side locations you can visit to loot them out of chests.

## "What followers are best to bring to Wheels of Lull?"

There is nothing in Wheels of Lull that outright blocks you from bringing followers, if you're inclined to run a squad. However, some parts of its quest line make having multiple followers actively problematic. These include:

* The "Sky Spy" quest, which specifically requires stealth, and also includes a scripted bit where you're captured. If you have multiple followers with you, the capture makes much less sense. Not to mention it'll likely ruin your chances of stealth.
* The quest "The Boiling Foundry" will send you into a dungeon that's essentially a giant platformer level. If you have too many followers with you, you will find it a lot more difficult to make it through this area.
* There are some initially unkillable monsters during the quest "The Brass Forest". The mod's recommendation is for you to sneak past them until you have the means to kill them properly. If you have a follower squad, your chances of doing this are significantly reduced.
* There are two different fights during the quest "The Bottom of the World" where you'll need to do a bunch of bash power attacks on minibosses. If you have multiple followers with you, they will very likely get in your way during the fight and put themselves at risk of taking your bash strikes.

Long story short, you may want to dismiss or at the very least pare down your follower squad before you run this mod.

## "What should I bring to run Wheels of Lull?"

### Light source

You should have a reliable light source, as multiple parts of this mod are _quite_ dark. Consider any of the light sources called out on the [Frequently Asked Questions: Lighting in Tuxborn](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-Lighting-in-Tuxborn/) page.

You may also need to invoke the Azurite Meditation power in your Powers list to adjust the lighting in the darkest parts of the mod, if you find that the above light sources still don't make things navigable enough for you.

### Recommended resistances, spells, and skills

You are absolutely going to want a reliable means of fire resistance. Preferably via enchantment of some sort on your armor and/or jewelry. 

If you have high skill in Alteration, then there are two spells that could also help. The Adept-level spell Fire Shell will kick your Fire Resistance up by 50%. The Master-level spell Flame Shield will kick it up by 75%. Both spells last only for 120 seconds, however. And since they're higher-level spells, you'd need enough skill in Alteration to cast them, and enough Magicka to keep them going.

High Sneak will be useful for the "Sky Spy" quest. Even better, a high enough Illusion skill so that you can cast Invisibility and/or Muffle.

There are multiple fights where you'll need to do some bash power attacks with a specific shield you'll find. So if you're not accustomed to fighting with shield + a one-handed melee weapon, you might want to practice that a bit before heading into this mod's quest line. You may or may not wish to spend some perk points on the lower-level perks on the Block skill tree. In particular, Defensive Maneuvers may be a good perk to unlock.

## "What are some other recommendations for running Wheels of Lull?"

### Walkthroughs

One of this mod's big points is its focus on puzzles and problem solving, vs. combat. If that's not your forte in Skyrim, and especially if you find some of the more complex levels difficult to figure out, you might need to check walkthroughs.

There are two different wikis you can consult for walkthrough info for this mod:

* [Trainwiz Mods quest overview page](https://trainwiz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wheels_of_Lull_-_Quest_Overview) - this is the wiki maintained by the creator of the mod
* [Wheels of Lull page](https://tes-mods.fandom.com/wiki/The_Wheels_of_Lull) on TES Mods wiki

The TES mods wiki has pretty much the same walkthroughs as the Trainwiz mods wiki, so use whichever you prefer.

There are also multiple walkthrough videos for the Boiling Foundry and Brass Forest quests on YouTube, so you may need to search for those to get through the most difficult parts.

### Recommended gear

There is a particular piece of gear that Avarri the smith in Lull-Mor can make for you, called a Sehtic Security Pack. You will _definitely_ want one of these. Its purpose is to teleport you back to the beginning of an area if you run into something that would otherwise kill you. And this will be especially critical when you run "The Boiling Foundry".

Depending on what enchantments you have available on your gear and what your Skills tree is looking like, you may also wish to stock up on the following potions:

* Resist Fire
* Invisibility
* Muffle
* Fortify Speed
* Fortify Sneak

## Potential issues to be on the lookout for

### Very easy to take a bad step in Lull-Mor

Even if you're doing side quests in Wheels of Lull or just exploring Lull-Mor in general, be mindful of where you step. The design of Lull-Mor makes it _very_ easy for you to accidentally fall and do damage to yourself, or even die, if you're not looking where you're going. This is _especially_ a problem inside the Librarium, since that place is designed in such a way that you have to cross a small, narrow walkway over a large space below you in order to get to the NPC that hangs out in there, Medeliu Hammar. Medeliu has a side quest that will result in you acquiring four displayable museum items, and depending on how you play out a different side quest, you may have to visit him for that, too. So assuming that you do want to take the time to run the side quests in this mod, you'll need to talk to Medeliu at least once.

Because of this, consider having Avarri make you the Sehtic Security Pack as soon as possible as insurance against this problem. And as noted above, make sure you have a reliable light source so you're sure of where you're stepping.

This warning also ties in to what we've said above about paring down (or outright dismissing) your follower squad. Our load order includes a tendency to move you farther than you might expect whenever you go through an exit that makes you change zones, if you're running several followers. In Lull-Mor, this means you may have a risk of taking a bad step _even if you didn't actually step that way_, if your follower squad just happens to push you too far when you all come through a door and you spawn in the wrong place.

### Shades of Mortality vs. the Sehtic Security Pack

The Sehtic Security Pack intercepts the Skyrim death mechanic, since its purpose is to teleport you back to the beginning of an area, rather than having you outright die and revert to your last save file. Since we are _also_ running Shades of Mortality, these two things may collide depending on how exactly you trigger a death in the mod. This could in turn cause you problems if you fall somewhere that doesn't give you an easy way back to where you need to be.

There are two potential ways to handle this:

1. If you did not disable Shades of Mortality in MO2 and are running it in your playthrough, you may wish to temporarily disable it and the Resurrection API, for as long as you're running Wheels of Lull. Or, at the very least, disable Shades during the specific quests "The Boiling Foundry" and "The Brass Forest", since those two quests in particular are the parts where you're most at risk of falling to your death and triggering this problem. Once you're past those two quests, you should be able to safely re-enable Shades of Mortality.
2. If you fall in such a way that Shades of Mortality kicks in rather than the Security Pack, you may need to resort to the `tcl` command in the console so that you can move yourself back to where you need to be. Use the command once to turn off collision, then use it again to re-enable collision once you're back on track.

### Wearing the Microclock may make your hands disappear in older Tuxborn builds

There is a piece of gear called a Microclock in Wheels of Lull, which essentially looks like a fancy clockwork watch (although it doesn't actually do anything).

If you're still running an 0.5.2 install of Tuxborn, _and_ you're playing a female Dragonborn, you may run into an issue where equipping the Microclock makes your hands disappear. This has been fixed in the mod since Tuxborn's 0.5.2 release, so this in theory _should not_ show up in Tuxborn's current build, as we did update what version of Wheels of Lull we're running.

As of the Wheels of Lull version included in 0.5.2, the Microclock was in theory able to be worn alongside other gloves. As of the version included in Tuxborn's current build, however, this is not the case. You will not be able to wear other gloves/gauntlets/bracers if you wish to wear the Microclock, so keep that in mind as you decide how much of the Wheels of Lull gear you want to actually use.

## "What is this mod about?"

A representative of House Hlaalu of Morrowind will come to you with a request to help his House track down and dispatch a dangerous criminal. And you'll quickly learn that this request is not as straightforward as it appears at first glance.

## "How do I start Moon and Star?"

This is another of the mods in our load order that requires you to complete The Way of the Voice. You must also be at least level 10.

Once you fulfill both of these requirements, you should receive a courier letter asking you to meet a contact at the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood.

## "What level is recommended to begin Moon and Star?"

You can start it at any time after level 10. Most of the mod will be very easy to run.

However, once you reach the mod's final location, the last boss may be a bit much for lower level characters. You may wish to hold off on going to Kagrenar until you're around level 30, unless you have a good squad of followers.

## "What followers are best to bring to Moon and Star?"

Player's choice on this. Bring whoever you like.

## "What should I bring to run Moon and Star?"

Again, player's choice. The only real fights you'll need to do are in the final part of the mod, where you should expect to be fighting Dwemer automatons of various levels. So bring whatever gear you feel is appropriate to do that.

## "Does Moon and Star have any displayable LOTD artifacts?"

Potential displayable artifacts are listed on [the Moon and Star section](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonborn_Hall_(SSE)#Moon_and_Star_Display) of the LOTD wiki page for Dragonborn Hall.

We say _potential_ here, because some of these items will depend on which thing you take as a quest reward at the end of the mod. And whatever items you do _not_ take might be easily missed if you don't know where else to look for them.

‼️ **If you click over to the individual items from the display section we link to, you will most likely see an important spoiler for this mod. So click with caution.** ‼️

## "What kinds of weapons and armor are available in Moon and Star?"

See previous section re: LOTD displayable items. Aside from those items, there isn't much in the way of obtainable gear.

## "Does Moon and Star have a player home?"

No.

Note however that Little Vivec, the village added to the game by this mod, is within a short distance of Lakeview Manor. Conveniently, since Little Vivec does include a general goods merchant amongst its residents, this puts a merchant even closer to Lakeview than Riverwood or Falkreath.

## "Does Moon and Star have any new followers?"

No.

## "What other custom items are in Moon and Star?"

Not much. One side quest available from the general goods merchant in Little Vivec, however, will award you a necklace that will give you +40 to Carry Weight. So that might be a useful thing to do early in your playthrough.

## "What side quests are available in Moon and Star?"

There are a small number of side quests you can do in Little Vivec, for the inhabitants of the village. None of them are critical to the completion of the mod, though see previous section re: the one for the general goods merchant.

The only quest in Little Vivec that we recommend as critical is the one for Bal-Ran, involving hunting down bandits he'd been tracking. All of the village quests, however, will help get you on the good side of everyone in the village, so you might want to do them regardless.

## "What are some other recommendations for running Moon and Star?"

‼️ **The following are spoilers for the mod. Click on each to expand.** ‼️

<details>
<summary><i>Is the criminal really who I think he is...?</i></summary>
<br>

This is a _very_ loose spoiler, because the clue for this is right in the name of the mod itself, and it's very easy to find this information if you do any research at all about this mod. But yes, he is in fact intended to be the Nerevarine, the hero of the storyline from The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.
</details>

<details>
<summary><i>Can I kill the criminal at the end of the mod...?</i></summary>
<br>

You can. But as Bal-Ran advises you in Little Vivec, think _very_ hard before making a decision on this. You should do what you feel is appropriate for your Dragonborn to do. But either choice will have consequences.
</details>

<details>
<summary><i>The weapon I asked for as a quest reward at the end didn't match the dialogue, what gives...?</i></summary>
<br>

This is another instance in our load order of mods conflicting on handling the exact same artifacts. We have a three-way conflict between Moon and Star, LOTD, and the Anniversary Edition when it comes to the quest rewards you can ask the Nerevarine for.

The original artifacts offered in Moon and Star are the Bow of Shadows, the Mace of Aevar Stone-Singer, and Chrysamere. With the patches we have installed, these weapons will be offered instead: the Staff of Hellfire, the Mace of Slurring, or Magebane.
</details>

<details>
<summary><i>How should I handle Mandyn Hlaalu at the end...?</i></summary>
<br>

He's going to attack you either way, so the only reason question is whether you give him back the Ring of Sanguine Resistance. If you want to keep that ring, don't give it back to him. Advice in the walkthrough we're linking to says that you won't be able to loot the ring back off of him when you kill him. (We will update this page if we confirm otherwise.)

<summary><i>I need more help on getting through this mod, where can I find a walkthrough...?</i></summary>

Try [this one](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=347340094), which was recommended on the mod's page on Nexus.

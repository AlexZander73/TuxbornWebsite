## Original Skyrim content

Here's the breakdown on which followers can respond to content in the original Skyrim base game, including main quest, faction quests, and vanilla side quests.

<details>
<summary><i>Guide to followers that comment on vanilla Skyrim content...</i></summary>

| Content | Followers that can comment | Type of commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Bards College | Auri | Auri, like Lucien, is confused as to why the Bards College wants you to go find an artifact for them rather than, say, perform a song |
| | Gore | Gore is not a fan of bards, and will not hesitate to say so if he sets foot in the Bards College with you. |
|                   | Lucien | Lucien has some admittedly justified points about why exactly a prospective bard is being asked to venture into a dangerous ruin for an artifact. |
|                   | Lydia | Lydia teases you about your motivations for joining the Bards College. |
| College of Winterhold | Lucien | Very reactive, lots to say about the college in general, and also your becoming Arch-Mage. |
| The Dark Brotherhood | Gore | Gore is known to rage-quit being your follower if you join the Dark Brotherhood. |
|                      | Lydia | Unless you disable the option that controls her faction reactions in her MCM, Lydia will likewise react very badly if you join the Brotherhood. |
| The Forsworn Conspiracy/No One Escapes Cidhna Mine | Gore | Gore will actually enter the mine with you in response to your being arrested, and will be stripped down to ragged trousers, to indicate he's now a prisoner too. |
| | Lydia | Has different reactions to this plot depending on how you choose to play it. Her opinions either way are quite strong, so choose wisely! She will not RP entering the mine with you when you're arrested, but may port in there with you anyway, so for RP purposes you may need to dismiss her. |
|                                                    | Remiel | Remiel will enter the mine with you, and react to the situation. She will not deal well with being underground. |
| In My Time of Need | Lydia | Lydia has differing reactions to this quest, depending on how you play it. |
| Laid to Rest | Lydia | As soon as you enter Morthal for the first time, Lydia will comment about whether you and she should investigate the burned down house situation. (Which raises the question of how, exactly, she knew about it before you got there.) |
| Main quest | Auri | Not as much commentary as others, but will react to your fighting Mirmulnir at the watchtower, and also has opinions about the Greybeards and about Delphine. She has a couple of passive lines while traveling, a dialogue box before riding Odahviing, and another dialogue speech after defeating Alduin. Her dialogue is easy to miss unless you have subtitles on, especially if you're running more talktative followers alongside her. |
|            | Gore | Gore has main quest commentary, but not usually thrown off as random remarks. You'll need to talk to him directly for him to give those comments. |
|            | Katana | Does not call you Dragonborn at any point, but she does react to main quest events, and remarks upon your impact and your power. |
|            | Lucien | Highly reactive to main quest events, including your becoming thane in Whiterun, as well as your first few dragon fights with him as your follower. He also has very strong reactions once you get to the point of meeting Paarthurnax, and acquiring the Elder Scroll. |
|            | Lydia | Will have critical reactions to all checkpoints of the main quest, as this version of Lydia is scripted to respond to all of them, and your interactions with her will progress as a result. |
|            | Remiel | Will generally have something to say about all stages of the main quest. |
|            | Xelzaz | Highly reactive to main quest, and very interested in your progression as Dragonborn. |
| Meeko | Remiel | If you get Meeko, and Remiel is your follower, she will have several charming Meeko-specific lines. |
| Rise in the East | Xelzaz | Xelzaz has a side quest that gives you a hook to run this quest. So if you're running Xel as a follower, run his Miscellaneous quest to find someone to improve his armor, and that will give you a hook to go run Rise in the East. Also, Xel will port to Japhet's Folly along with you, and he has regular running commentary about the situation. |
| The Blessings of Nature | Lucien | Lucien will have different reactions to the ending of this quest, depending on how you choose to play it. |
|                         | Lydia | Lydia will likewise have different reactions to this quest's end, depending on how you play it. |
| The House of Horrors | Gore | Gore will actively freak out at you about Molag Bal, if he's with you when you run this quest. |
|                      | Lydia | Depending on how you choose to play this quest, you may provoke an extremely strong reaction out of Lydia, up to and including her outright attacking you if she thinks you've decided to serve Molag Bal. |
| The White Phial | Xelzaz | As a master alchemist, Xel is naturally interested in the White Phial. And he'll be mortally offended at how stingy Nurelion is! |
| Thieves Guild | Auri | Auri has extensive commentary on the Thieves Guild plot, although some of it is only available if you talk directly to her. She considers herself to join the guild along with you, and is very much in favor of a Robin-Hood-style approach, and not beating up on shopkeepers to get their money. |
| | Lydia | Unless you turn off the option in her MCM that allows her to react to your joining factions, Lydia will not be happy if you join the Thieves Guild. |
| | Remiel | Remiel is pro-thievery, as she engages in it herself. She has extensive commentary on Thieves Guild plot events. |
| | Xelzaz | Xel is not actively hostile to you joining the Thieves Guild, but he is not terribly impressed by the initial Thieves Guild tasks, or the state of the Guild. He does however participate in Guild actions with you, and reacts to them. He'll have very strong commentary about your relationship to Nocturnal once you become a Nightingale. |

## Skyrim DLCs

These followers are known to have commentary related to Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and Hearthfire.

<details>
<summary><i>Guide to followers that comment on Skyrim DLCs...</i></summary>

| Content | Followers that can comment | Type of commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dawnguard | Auri | Auri has some running commentary on the Dawnguard plotline, though not as much as other more talkative followers. She does, however, take very kindly to Serana, in no small part because of their mutual interest in eating their enemies. :D |
| | Lydia | Lydia is _very_ much in favor of fighting vampires with the Dawnguard. She also is not very pleased about Serana at first, but is not actively hostile to her, and warms up to her after you escape the Soul Cairn. And she has one initial direct conversation with Serana, so be sure and take the time to let that conversation play out so you can hear it. |
| | Remiel | Remiel reacts when you release Serana from her obelisk, and continues to make commentary as you proceed through the plotline. |
| | Xelzaz | Xelzaz will insist on taking Serana straight to Fort Dawnguard. He is also known to be hostile to your joining the Volkihar vampires, if you play Dawnguard on the vampires' side, but he will _not_ be hostile to you if Serana turns you into a vampire lord to enter the Soul Cairn. He also has very smart commentary all throughout the plot, especially at the Soul Cairn, and he'll give you a very appropriate reason why he can't accompany you in. |
| Dragonborn | Gore | Gore will react to your initially being attacked by Miraak's cultists, and will want to know if you and he are going to Solstheim once this happens. |
|            | Lucien | In general Lucien does not have much general Dragonborn/Solstheim commentary. He does have a couple of general remarks that appear to be in response to Solstheim content, but nothing specific to the Dragonborn quest. Most of Lucien's Solstheim-related commentary is centered around his personal quest, which will eventually take you to a location on that island. |
| | Remiel | Remiel has considerable commentary during the entirety of the Dragonborn plot. |
| | Xelzaz | As he is a member of House Telvanni, Xelzaz will interact quite a bit with Neloth in Tel Mithryn, and some with his apprentice Talvas as well. He reacts strongly to the presence of the Morag Tong on the island, as this ties in with his own personal backstory. |
| Hearthfire | Lydia | Unlike vanilla Lydia, modded Lydia explicitly will not agree to be steward of any of the Hearthfire houses, and she'll give you her reasons why not if you ask her if she wants to do this. |
</details>

## Anniversary Edition content

These followers have known commentary to content specific to the Anniversary Edition. 

<details>
<summary><i>Guide to followers that comment on Anniversary Edition content...</i></summary>

| Content | Followers that can comment | Type of commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The Dwarven Horse | Lucien | Lucien is _very_ reactive to this, as he's absolutely delighted about discovering the Dwarven Horse. Recommended quest to run if you're a Lucien fan! |
| Forgotten Seasons | Lucien | Lucien is very reactive to this quest, and has running commentary all throughout it. |
| Ghosts of the Tribunal | Xelzaz | Xelzaz should have some commentary on the plot from Ghosts of the Tribunal. |
| The Rising Dead | Lucien | Lucien will react to the initial courier letter you get that launches this quest, as well as to when you arrive at the ritual site. |
</details>

## Mod content

Followers in this list have commentary specific to various mods.

<details>
<summary><i>Guide to followers that comment on assorted mods in the Tuxborn load order...</i></summary>

| Content | Followers that can comment | Type of commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Beyond Reach | Remiel | Remiel has about 250 lines for Beyond Reach. |
| Beyond Skyrim: Bruma | Lucien | Lucien has a lot of general commentary about Bruma, not surprisingly, since he's Imperial. Recommended follower to bring, if you want to run Bruma. |
| | Lydia | Lydia in our load order should also have considerable dialogue while running Bruma! |
| Legacy of the Dragonborn | Lydia | Reacts to your museum progress, and also has commentary about Auryen. |
|                          | Remiel | Highly reactive, will interact with and has commentary about Explorers Society NPCs, will want to join the Explorers Society herself, and has commentary about Auryen, LOTD quests, and the Safehouse. Definitely best follower to run in an LOTD playthrough. | 
| Moon and Star | Lucien | |
| Moonpath to Elsweyr | Lucien | Lucien has good commentary on this mod, not surprisingly, given that his author also wrote the bugfix patch for Moonpath that we include in Tuxborn. | 
| Saints and Seducers Extended Cut | Gore | |
| Sirenroot | Xelzaz | Xelzaz does not interact with other NPCs in this mod, but he does offer you hints and waterbreathing potions. |
| Unfaltered Virtue | Lydia | The author of the Lydia mod we're running also wrote Unfaltered Virtue, so Lydia has built-in commentary for this mod. |
| Vigilant | Gore | Gore is set up to react to Vigilant, but if you bring him into that mod, he will not be unscathed. Plan accordingly. |
| Wyrmstooth | Lydia | Reacts to Wyrmstooth quest events, and also has general commentary about the island. |
| | Xelzaz | Starts delivering commentary about Wyrmstooth as soon as you meet Lurius Liore in the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. |
</details>

## Houses

These followers have commentary on your houses. This gets its own category just because certain followers have commentary on specific houses!

<details>
<summary><i>Guide to followers that comment on houses...</i></summary>

| Content | Followers that can comment | Type of commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All houses | Lucien | Lucien has a set of remarks he'll fire off in any of your houses, aside from the ones that are house-specific. |
|            | Remiel | Remiel has a few remarks she'll make about any of your houses, generally along the lines of it being pleasant to return to your own space after adventuring. |
| Hearthfire houses | Auri | If you marry Auri, be wary of asking her to settle in any of the Hearthfire houses with you. She'll take very badly to that, as they're made out of wood. |
| Proudspire Manor | Lucien | Lucien is _very_ happy to volunteer to manage Proudspire Manor for you, if you'll buy it. |
| The Safehouse | Remiel | Remiel has specific commentary about the Safehouse, especially once you invite her to live there. |
| Tundra Homestead | Lucien | Lucien thinks Tundra Homestead is very charming. |
</details>

## Commentary with other followers

Several of our custom followers are set up to have varying degrees of commentary with _other_ custom followers. So if that appeals to you, use this table to guide your choices on who all you might want in your follower squad.

We recommend that to get the most out of follower banter, try not to have too big of a squad at once. Otherwise you'll miss out on a lot of your followers' best lines as they talk over each other!

You may assume that in this table, all interactions listed are two-way, and we're not duplicating entries just for the sake of brevity. So we have an entry for Auri - Gore, but not one for Gore - Auri, just because the Auri - Gore entry already covers them. Entries listed are based on alphabetical order of follower names.

<details>
<summary><i>Guide to followers that talk with each other...</i></summary>
<br>

| Follower | Follower they interact with | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auri | Gore | A few conversations about Bosmer culture, including what they drink in Valenwood, and how Bosmer mothers treat their children |
| Auri | Inigo | Inigo is nervous about Auri eating him, although Auri seems to take it in good fun. He'll also ask her to tell his fleas to take a day off. |
| Auri | Lucien | Not as much interaction as with other pairs, but there's a notable conversation where Lucien gets a little too interested in what Auri sings, and one where Auri gets to fluster Lucien _considerably_ |
| Auri | Remiel | Lots of conversation between these two, pertaining to Bosmer culture, differences in Bosmer and Breton religious beliefs, and Remiel's pet automaton Scrap |
| Gore | Remiel | An entire subplot involving Remiel teaching Gore how to read, a conversation that triggers if you bring both of them into a shop (at which point they both get rather rude to the shopkeeper), a considerable amount of teasing, and at least one conversation where Remiel's lines don't seem to actually have voiced audio (but you can see her lines if you play with subtitles on) |
| Inigo | Lucien | A bunch of riffing on Ragnar the Red, in-depth analysis of Inigo dreaming about sweet rolls, and more |
| Inigo | Lydia | Some minor exchanges, but note that they will be in Lydia's original voice, since the patch we have doesn't account for the modded version of Lydia we're running |
| Lucien | Lydia | As with Inigo, a small amount of interaction between these two, but it'll be in Lydia's original voice, so you may or may not find this distracting |
| Remiel | Xelzaz | Remiel and Xelzaz are _very_ interactive, and will start conversing with each other as soon as you have both of them recruited. They converse on a wide variety of topics! And like Lucien and Inigo, these two _also_ riff on Ragnar the Red |

</details>

## Miscellaneous

These followers have commentary on things not specifically related to quests, mod, or faction content.

<details>
<summary><i>Guide to followers that comment on miscellaneous topics...</i></summary>
<br>

| Content | Followers that can comment on it | Type of commentary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Absorbing dragon souls | Inigo | Inigo has, shall we say, some _very_ strong opinions on your absorbing dragon souls. |
|                        | Lucien | Lucien's reactions to your taking souls aren't as extensive as Inigo's, but he does have some entertaining lines about it, reflecting his scholarly bent. |
|                        | Xelzaz | Like Lucien, Xelzaz is curious about whether dragon souls taste like anything in particular. |
| Backstory | Gore | Gore has a lot of random comments about his backstory with the Ravens. |
|           | Remiel | Remiel talks about a lot of her childhood and adolescence. |
|           | Xelzaz | Xel will tell you some things about his background in House Telvanni. |
| Bandits | Auri | Auri has a couple of remarks about bandits that reflect the Bosmer practice of eating their enemies.
|         | Gore | Gore frequently talks about bandits as prey. |
|         | Gorr | Gorr will frequently talk about killing bandits being one of his favorite pastimes. |
|         | Lucien | Lucien reflects a lot about the life of bandits, while in a bandit lair or after fighting bandits with you. |
|         | Lydia | Lydia has very strong opinions on bandits, and will urge you to leave none of them alive. |
|         | Remiel | Remiel thinks bandits are pathetic, because there are much more elegant ways to rob people blind. |
| Calcelmo | Remiel | Remiel _really_ doesn't like Calcelmo. This will manifest not only as part of running Remiel's intro quest, but also in Remiel's reactions to the launch of Much Ado About Snow Elves in Legacy of the Dragonborn. She has some very hostile exchanges with him, too. |
| Cities | Aviendha | As soon as you recruit her, Aviendha is a fan of Whiterun and will have random positive commentary about the city. She'll also interact a lot with Ysolda and Adrianne. |
| | Gore | Gore has commentary about all cities in Skyrim. |
|                     | Lucien | Lucien also has commentary about all cities in Skyrim. |
| Chopping firewood | Auri | Auri has some tart words for you if she sees you chopping firewood in front of her. |
| Combat | Auri | If you're fighting a hostile Bosmer, Auri may taunt them by calling them a salad-eater. |
|        | Gore | Gore has a variety of combat taunts he'll hurl at enemies. |
|        | Lucien | Lucien doesn't taunt per se, but he'll often ask enemies if they've considered _not_ murdering him. He will also make awkward jokes about "see here" when fighting Falmer. |
|        | Remiel | Remiel will call enemies milk-drinker, but, y'know, kinda cutely. |
| Crafting | Gore | Gore will comment if you're working at an Alchemy or Enchanting station. |
|          | Lucien | Lucien will also comment if you're working at an Alchemy or Enchanting station. |
|          | Katana | Katana will react to your working at a forge. |
|          | Xelzaz | Xelzaz will frequently give you tips while you're working at an alchemy table. If your Alchemy level is still pretty low, this may even bump you up a point. |
| Daedric Princes | Gore | Gore is very clearly wigged out by Molag Bal. See above re: The House of Horrors. |
|                 | Lydia | Lydia will react _very_ badly if she thinks you're following any of the more malevolent Daedra, up to the point of bailing on you as your follower, or even outright attacking you. |
|                 | Xelzaz | Xel is not generally a fan of the Daedric Princes, and is known to snark heavily on both Meridia and Nocturnal. |
| Dragons | Lucien | Lucien has specific reactions to his first few dragon fights with you. |
| | Lydia | Lydia has several combat taunts for dragons, including warning that they'll be extremely surprised by _you_. |
| Dwemer ruins | Lucien | Lucien has a lot of happy commentary about Dwemer ruins, since that's one of his scholarly interests. |
|              | Remiel | Remiel likewise has a lot of commentary about Dwemer ruins, especially given that taking her to some is part of her personal set of quests. |
| Food | Gore | Gore has several comments about hunting, and about how horker meat is delicious. |
| | Gorr | Food is Gorr's other favorite pastime, so he has a lot of commentary about what he likes to eat. He also has an amusing line about eating Alduin, once he knows you need to kill him. |
| | Xelzaz | Xel has several lines about his favorite recipes. |
| The Greybeards | Auri | If she's with you when you visit High Hrothgar, Auri may demand to know where the female Greybeards are, or wonder if the Greybeards can teach _her_ a Shout or two. |
| Magic | Remiel | Remiel has commentary on what schools of magic she's good at. |
|       | Xelzaz | Xel has some _opinions_ about the Empire outlawing levitation, and also about the foolishness of people who refuse to use magic. |
| Mills | Auri | As a devout follower of the Green Pact, Auri is _really_ not a fan of being anywhere near a mill. |
| Netches | Auri | Auri loves netches on Solstheim, and makes admiring comments about their wobbly legs. |
| | Remiel | Remiel says she'd like to start a netch ranch if she were to settle on Solstheim. |
| | Xelzaz | Xelzaz is not a fan of the idea of hunting netches for sport. |
| Politics | Gore | Gore has remarks about Imperial and Thalmor politics if you're anywhere in Haafingar. He's also highly contemptuous of Ulfric Stormcloak, and of Siddgeir in Falkreath. |
|          | Lydia | Lydia has critical commentary about court politics in Whiterun when you first meet her, about the war, and about how the Jarls are honoring merchants rather than the men and women fighting for Skyrim. She has supportive commentary about General Tullius, and some side-eying of Elisif. She's not necessarily directly hostile to Ulfric Stormcloak, but she worries about how the people of Eastmarch are managing under his rule. |
|          | Remiel | Remiel also side-eyes Elisif, and wonders if she's a puppet ruler. |
| Shops | Auri | If she's with you as you enter a shop, Auri will sometimes stage-whisper for you to distract the clerk while she steals some goods. |
|           | Gore | Gore is generally contemptuous of merchants, so you may not want him with you while you're shopping. One possible exception to this is Belethor, since he seems to be aware and amused that Belethor is a sleaze. |
|           | Remiel | If you're running Remiel _and_ Gore, they have a scene that can trigger in a shop that underscores that wow, yeah, Gore is really not a fan of merchants. |
| Singing | Auri | Auri has a song she'll periodically sing at random. |
|         | Inigo | If you're running him along with Lucien, they will riff quite a bit on "Ragnar the Red".
|         | Jesper | Jesper has a few different songs he'll sing bits of at random, including a bit of "Toss a Coin to Your Witcher."
|         | Lucien | Lucien also has a few different songs he'll periodically sing bits of, including his own version of "Toss a Coin to Your Witcher". He will also riff a lot on "Ragnar the Red", _especially_ if you're also running Inigo. Sometimes though Lucien will just legit sing the first bits of "Ragnar the Red" or "The Dragonborn Comes". |
|         | Xelzaz | Xel will often speak-sing to himself, and has interesting commentary about why, if you ask him about it. |
| Sneaking | Gore | Gore may complain that crouching hurts his back. He may also urge you to get some drinking money, as he's working up a thirst! |
|       | Lucien | Lucien has a few amusing different lines reacting to sneaking with you. |
| Slavery | Xelzaz | Xel has some things to say about slavery, how House Telvanni has handled the transition away from slavery in Morrowind, and the status of what few slaves remain there. |
| Thievery | Remiel | Remiel will sometimes wonder about why beggars just don't take what they need. |
| Weather | Auri | Auri reacts happily when it rains, but is not happy when it's cold/snowing. |
|         | Lucien | Lucien will urge you to pick up the pace when it's raining. |
| Your current condition | Gore | Gore will react in combat if he sees your health is low. |
|                        | Katana | Katana will have commentary if she sees you being overloaded, or if your health is low. |
| Your current gear | Auri | If you're wearing heavy armor, Auri will ask you if you _have_ to alert every bandit in the vicinity. |
| Your current skill levels | Lydia | Lydia has extensive reactions to your skill levels in just about everything, and her commentary will change as you progress in those skills. |

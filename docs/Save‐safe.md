Some of you will want to play this list across multiple systems, in particular those who have both handheld and powerful desktop. You can do this for the most part and even use a more graphical intense profile if you so desire, as long as you remember two rules. 1: Saves Tuxborn and TuxBFCO profiles don’t work with each other. 2: Only Handheld and Desktop saves work with each other, Deck doesn’t. Alternatively you can look at the images below, if they are with the same color they are safe compatible.

The Deck profile isn’t safe compatible with the rest of the profiles because it’s missing some mods to keep performance stable. Mods like Dyndolod don’t like being turned off and on within a running save. But you also don’t need to worry about the performance issue with stuff like Lotd as much with Handheld on a system like the Steam Deck, since you do those sections on your desktop if needed. Just remember to save before you go into the museum, that way you can easily reload (and even try again on the Steam Deck if you want to).

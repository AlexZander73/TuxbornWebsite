This page is to give an overview of what parts of base game Skyrim quests are impacted by mods in our load order. We're only covering quests here specifically, as opposed to architecture, environment, weather, creatures, mechanics, etc. (Otherwise this page would be much shorter, because, well, _everything_ in Tuxborn impacts Skyrim in one way or another!)

## Main quest

These mods impact the main quest.

| Main quest stage | Mod | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unbound | [Alternate Start - Live Another Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272) | We've limited the number of options available for chargen in Alternate Start, and this includes removal of the original starting quest in Helgen. Accordingly, to kick off the main quest, you will need to visit Helgen on your own so that you can witness Alduin flying off after he's destroyed the place. See the [Main quest](Main-quest/) page for more details. |
| Paarthurnax | [Paarthurnax - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51711) | Expansion of the quest that launches when the Blades demand that you kill Paarthurnax. |
| All stages of the main quest | [Improved Follower Dialogue - Lydia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38473) | While the Lydia mod we're running doesn't actually change any beats of the main Skyrim story, Lydia is significantly expanded as a character, and will have reactions to each and every part of the main quest. These, in turn, play into her new story arc. |
| | Other custom followers | To one degree or another, just about all the custom followers we're running have reactions to main quest events. |

## Side quests

This covers vanilla Skyrim side quests, including the ones for Daedric artifacts, and what mods impact them.

| Boethian's Calling | [Boethiah's Calling - Alternate Questline](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121499) | Adds a new quest which ties into the main Boethiah quest, and gives you an alternate route by which you can acquire the Ebony Mail without having to sacrifice a loyal friend. |
| Caught Red Handed | [Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65708) | Changes the side quest in Riften where you discover way too much information about how Haelga likes to spend her time, and allows for alternate outcomes. |
| Discerning the Transmundane | [Harvest Your Blood For Septimus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69861) | Tweaks the quest to allow you to harvest your own blood for Septimus, if you're playing an elf. |
| A Good Death | [A Good Death - Old Orc Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69861) | Expands the random world encounter where you find an old Orc who wants you to give him a good death. Gives him more dialogue to explain why he wants this. |

| Telrav's Request | [Nilheim - Misc Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53792) | Small expansion of the local quest you can run at Nilheim. |
| The Heart of Dibella | [The Heart of Dibella - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94863) | Provides an alternate means to start this quest, as well as a general expansion of it. |

## Dawnguard

See the [Dawnguard](Dawnguard/) page for more information.

## Dragonborn

See the [Dragonborn](Dragonborn/) page.

## Anniversary Edition

The following mods impact Anniversary Edition content.

| Mod | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| [CC Farming](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69029) | Significantly changes Goldenglow Plantation, and the quest for acquiring it. See the Goldenglow section of the [Vanilla player homes available in Tuxborn](Vanilla-player-homes-available-in-Tuxborn/) page for details.
| [Knight of the North](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45869) | Overhauls the Relics of the Crusader quest in the AE. Can work in tandem with a similar quest in Legacy of the Dragonborn. |
| Legacy of the Dragonborn | LOTD has multiple impacts on AE content. See next table. |
| [Morihaus' Refuge - Lord's Mail Reintegration](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68558) | Overhauls the quest to get the Lord's Mail, and moves acquiring it down to a location in Cyrodiil.<sup>1</sup> |
| Multiple AE quests | We are running several mods that add voiced narration to various AE quests. |
| Night Hunter | The crossbow mod [Thwack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42653) ties the AE quest Night Hunter into the tail end of Sorine Jurard's crossbow schematics quests in Dawnguard. |
| [On a Crimson Trail](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52647) | Provides a structured framing story for all of the Alternative Armors related to the Crimson Dirks. |
| [Rebalancing Anniversary Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61004) | Adjusts a lot of the requirements for a large number of the AE quests, including getting houses and Alternative Armor sets. |
| [Skyrim Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772) | Significant overhaul of the Saints & Seducers Creation in the AE. |

### Legacy of the Dragonborn AE changes

| Creation name | LOTD impact |
| --- | --- |
| Bow of Shadows | The weapon you get from running the quest In the Shadows, where you save Jarl Balgruuf from assassination, is renamed the Bow of Obfuscation. This is because LOTD has the Bow of Shadows as an obtainable relic in its own content. |
| Divine Crusader | LOTD alters the quest Relics of the Crusader, turning acquisition of those armor sets into a scavenger hunt. NOTE: Knight of the North alters that same quest, but LOTD's version and Knight of the North's version are supposed to co-exist in our load order, and you should be able to follow either path to find the items. |

## Notes
1. Legacy of the Dragonborn _also_ changes the Lord's Mail AE quest. It swaps out the item you'd normally get via the AE quest with [Minor Lord's Mail](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Minor_Lord%27s_Mail). Since both Morihaus' Refuge and LOTD impact the same quest, we will document here what actual item you get when running Morihaus' Refuge when that is confirmed.

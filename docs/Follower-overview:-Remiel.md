---

Remiel is currently one of the most beloved followers amongst the Tuxborn players on the Aetherius Modding Discord. She's a Breton with a passionate interest in all things Dwemer: ruins, automatons, weaponry, and more. Remi has extensive commentary on almost every aspect of the game, and is hands down the recommended follower to run to support a Legacy of the Dragonborn playthrough.

She is one of the most richly characterized followers in our load order, with a great deal you can discover about her as you interact with her. This will include a personal quest you can run with her, as well as a romance option. 

## Where and when to recruit her

Remiel can be found at the Silver-Blood Inn in Markarth. You'll need to strike up a conversation with her, and once you do, she'll eventually try to hire you to escort her into the ruins of Nchuand-Zel.

Given this as a starting condition for finding her, you _probably_ don't want to recruit her right out of the gate in your game, since you'll need to be able to run Nchuand-Zel properly to play through her intro quest. You _can_ in theory skip that quest, but we recommend doing it if you haven't done it before, just because it gives you a good excuse to run the place. (And there _are_ artifacts in Nchuand-Zel that are displayable in the LOTD museum!)

Legacy of the Dragonborn, however, will give you a good excuse to head to Markarth once you need to recruit the members of your Explorers Society guild. And since you need to go visit Calcelmo's dig to pick up Madras as part of that objective, that will put you in a very good position to pick up Remiel as a follower and run her intro quest. Finishing that quest will let Remiel build her pet automaton Scrap, and will make her actively recruitable as a follower.

### ‼️ An important tip ‼️
When running Remiel's intro quest in Nchuand-Zel, be on the lookout for unusual Dwemer components. Give these to Remiel so that she can use them to build you a useful device to keep track of her! This item, Remiel's Contraption, is what will give you the capabilities described in the next section.

## How to summon her

You'll have a Call Remi spell in your spells list that you can use to bring her back to you, if you get separated from her. You'll also get a couple of miscellaneous quest objectives you can use to track her, as well: one to point out her current location, and one to mark her current known place of residence. You can use either of these as supplements to the Call Remi spell, as your RP needs require.

## Best follower use

Remiel's a great follower to consider if you want to do a Thieves Guild run. Her personal moral compass as well as her family history lean towards the wrong side of the law, and so she's actively friendly to thievery. You can ask her to lockpick for you, if you don't want to pick locks yourself, or if you don't intend to use any of Tuxborn's available lock-opening spells.

She's not very powerful at magic, but she _does_ do some personal study at healing spells. If you don't have a stronger Restoration mage in your party (such as Megara), you can ask her to heal you in combat. Likewise, she experiments with alchemy. But if you're brave enough to try any of her potions, expect unpredictable results.

Fighting-wise, Remiel is probably best for one-handed or ranged fighting. As part of her personal side quests, she will eventually develop her own crossbow.

Hands down, though, her best use is as a supporting follower for Legacy of the Dragonborn. 

## Level of commentary to you

As one of the most talkative followers in our load order, Remiel will have a great deal to say on a wide variety of topics. This includes making remarks directly to you, as well as commenting on current events.

It's a very good idea to try to talk directly to Remi on a regular basis, as this will help you spot new dialogue options that will let you unlock bits of her personal quest. Take advantage of opportunities to tell her to relax in safe places, in particular, such as your houses or in inns.

## Level of commentary about main quest, side quests, factions, and mods

Remiel has a great deal of commentary about vanilla Skyrim content, including the main quest, the College of Winterhold, the Thieves Guild, Dawnguard, etc.

She also has a vast amount of reaction to Legacy of the Dragonborn, including not only general remarks, but <i>also</i> interactions with Legacy NPCs. She will frequently interact with the main NPCs you recruit for the Explorer's Society. She can even be set up to live at the Safehouse, and actively leaps on the chance to join the Explorer's Society, without you even needing to do much to recruit her.

So she is hands down the best follower to run as a primary follower, if you want to focus on a LOTD playthrough in Tuxborn.

## Level of commentary with other followers

Additionally, Remiel has a lot of great interactions with other followers. Her strongest interactions are with Gore, Auri, and Xelzaz. So if you're inclined to run Remi in conjunction with one or more other followers, put heavy thought into those as your candidates.

Of the three, we most recommend Xelzaz, as the conversations Remiel and Xelzaz have together are splendid ways to get glimpses of the backstories of both characters, as well as how both of them think. (In particular, look for how Remiel reacts when Xelzaz gives you Roovi!) 

But that said, Remiel has great interactions with Gore involving teaching him to read, and she and Auri together are a menace to shopkeepers everywhere.

## Some important notes

Remiel's creator has a [guide/FAQ document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUNNalaj6alRwRiY9shqu8AE-NBmNLIR/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.p0n7xkrlutjs) available on Google Docs, if you have issues running her that you need to solve.

Tuxborn players have reported that Remiel has a habit of disappearing for no apparent reason. Should this happen, use the Call Remi spell to bring her back to you. Or use the miscellaneous quests described above to find her.

Dialogue available to you with Remiel will eventually reveal that she is canonically asexual, although that term is not used. She is not, however, aromantic. She _can_ be romanced. She's just not interested in sex.

And, although again the actual term is not used, Remiel's general chatter dialogue heavily implies that she is neurodivergent, somewhere on the autism spectrum.

# Overview

This page is dedicated to the vanilla player homes available in Tuxborn. We have all available standard Skyrim homes, including base game, DLC, and Anniversary Edition homes. We're not going to go over them in depth on this page, since that's covered well by the UESP site.

All of these are available in Tuxborn as per regular Skyrim gameplay. _Most_ of them are available via the vanilla means. We'll go into further detail on the exceptions further down the page.

All links in this section are off to the pages for these various homes on the UESP. Consult those links for further information about these homes, especially any known bugs that still exist for them.

## More on the city homes

### Breezehome

Still an excellent choice for a starter home, due to being located in Whiterun and right next door to Warmaiden's. If you choose to house your family here, you can make up for the lack of a full set of crafting stations in the house by getting the Dev Aveza, or any other house to contain your crafting stations.

### Hjerim

Large, which is nice. But not available to you unless you want to be a Stormcloak and become Ulfric's thane, _or_ unless you want to run the civil war on the side of the Imperials and become Brunwulf's thane. Either way, you also still have to run Blood on the Ice.

### Honeyside

Decent if you like Riften, and in particular if you want to maintain an "upright citizen" veneer for Riften-based RP, whether or not you're actually in the Thieves Guild. Two issues that may be dealbreakers for Honeyside:

* No in-house forge or smelter, and Balimund's forge _also_ has no smelter
* The fishing spot at the base of Honeyside's back stairs is buggy because of the carriage and ferry operators mod in Tuxborn. So if you plan to do fishing, that particular spot is _not_ recommended

### Proudspire Manor

Lovely, but also pricy. Useful to consider if you want Solitude to be your home base, since it gives you a place to actually house your family, and Legacy of the Dragonborn does not have a built-in way to house your family in the Safehouse.

### Vlindrel Hall

Also large, with good storage space, especially for books. Worth considering if you like the overall Dwemer look. Crafting stations are limited to an enchanter table and an alchemy table, but Markarth has _two_ forges, so it's still very easy to do any smithing there.

## More on the DLC homes

Severin Manor is basically your option if you want to headquarter on Solstheim. The house is well-equipped with a forge, a smelter, an alchemy table, and an enchanting table. Storage space is decent for armor, weapons, and books. You do have to run three quests in order to get access to the house, though: The Final Descent, March of the Dead, and Served Cold. We recommend you knock those quests out as early as possible on Solstheim, just to take ownership of the house.

The three Hearthfire homes, Lakeview Manor, Heljarchen Hall, and Windstad Manor, are still decent homes to consider as potential home bases. All of these will have the appropriate set of vanilla crafting stations once you build them out to your satisfaction (except for a staff enchanter). Once you hire a steward, that also gives you a handy source of building materials, for the quests to build the guildhall and the outposts in Legacy of the Dragonborn. And you can safely move families to them.

These homes become less critical in a LOTD-based load order. But if you want to avoid playing LOTD in Tuxborn, these are still worth consideration. 

For all three of the Hearthfire homes, you will need to run the appropriate quest to get the favor of the Jarl and get permission to buy the property to build on:

* Kill the Bandit Leader in Falkreath
* Kill the Giant in Dawnstar
* Laid to Rest in Morthal

You do _not_ need to be thane yet in those places to buy the land and build the houses. But if you choose to buy the land while you're working on getting the thaneship, then the houses can be good places for you to sleep while you're doing that.

## More on the Anniversary Edition homes

Several of the Anniversary Edition homes are known to be buggy. Bugs include objects that fall over or fall off of shelves when you enter the space, weapons racks that stop working, and also, issues with you being able to move a family into them, to the tune of those characters being at risk of vanishing from the game. So doublecheck UESP pages for any of the AE homes _before_ you consider moving a family to them. (We've provided links to the relevant UESP pages above.)

While a bunch of the AE homes have display spaces for a lot of Skyrim's artifacts (vanilla/AE ones, anyway), none of them have display spaces for ALL of them. And in a load order that contains Legacy of the Dragonborn, usefulness of those displays is much reduced. However, if you want to skip running Legacy of the Dragonborn and use AE houses to store your loot instead, doublecheck which AE houses can display which artifacts and choose accordingly.

### Goldenhills Plantation

See [Goldenhills Plantation](Goldenhills-Plantation/) for further details on this home, as it is heavily modified in our load order and has its own full wiki page here.

### Hendraheim

Easy to get. And if you're doing stuff in the eastern parts of the Reach, it's good to have as a secondary home base, even if it's not your primary. It's subject to the general bugs all AE homes are at risk of, as noted above.

The quest to acquire Hendraheim, while easy to run, is bumped up to a higher level because of the Rebalancing Anniversary Edition mod. Default level to get Hendraheim is level 10, but the RAE requirement is 25. So if you feel 25 is too a high a level and you want Hendraheim earlier than that, adjust the MCM for RAE to what you want. 

You have to fight the warrior Eydvina Shield-Hearth to take control of the house. She can be a little challenging at early levels, as she has a sword that does fire damage. But if you're well-geared, have a good supporting squad of followers, or both, you should be able to take her out quickly.

Hendraheim has very good storage space, with lots of weapons racks and armor mannequins. Its cellar also includes a decent assortment of displays for named artifacts. And its proximity to several important locations (Lost Valley Redoubt, Runoff Caverns, Bilegulch Mine, Fort Sungard, and Rorikstead) makes it useful to consider as a secondary home base at the very least, if not your primary. 

### Other AE homes

#### Bloodchill Cavern

Nice and large, lots of storage space, but vibe is definitely "vampire" and that may or may not work for you. Also, it's in the frozen heart of Winterhold, so not an ideal location. Unless you're a vampire, and/or a very misanthropic Dragonborn.

You will have to fight assorted vampires and gargoyles to claim this house. Of those vampires, the waiter in particular is level 65. So you should either be very well geared up before you come in to fight him, bring a good follower squad with you, or both.

If you're a vampire, the fight will play out slightly differently, and you'll also have to kill a Dawnguard agent. So expect that as well.

Storage space for armor and weapons is excellent, as there are a bunch of weapons racks and mannequins. There are displays for Dawnguard items. And this is one of the few AE homes that actually has a storage spot for the halves of the Amethyst Dragon Claw from the Dragonborn DLC.

#### Dead Man’s Dread

The vibe on this one is "YAAR PIRATES". But it's also another remote location and not exactly the best place to bring up adopted kids, unless you do in fact want to train them as pirates.

General storage space is good, but there aren't any display places for AE artifacts.

#### Gallows Hall

Maybe not the best choice for most playthroughs, but would well suit a necromancer build, especially if you're not intending to put a family there.

Two notable features in the house are an altar that will convert Greater or Grand Soul Gems to Black Soul Gems, and the skeleton forge which creates permanent skeleton followers.

#### Myrwatch

Good as a secondary home base if you're doing stuff in the vicinity of Morthal. Excellent vibe for mages.

Tuxborn has a small additional requirement to unlock access to Myrwatch, from the Rebalancing Anniversary Edition mod. By default, that mod requires you to have 350 Magicka before you can use the Flames spell to unlock access to the house. If that number is too high for your tastes, you can adjust it in the mod's MCM.

Storage space is decent for armor, weapons, and books. 

#### Nchuanthumz

The quest to build this place out is great, and also A++ if you're into Dwemer stuff. However, it's way over on the eastern edge of the map and the thing closest to it is Kagrenzel. So maybe not the best parenting choice in the world to move your kids next door to a Falmer hive!

#### Shadowfoot Sanctum

_Great_ vibe if you're playing a thief, the hidden loot chamber is fantastic. Also includes thief-based displays for Guild and Nightingale stuff. You may or may not want to have your kids and spouse living in the Ratway with you; consider putting them in Honeyside instead, if you want to headquarter in Riften.

#### Tundra Homestead

Very pretty and cozy, but also very optional if you already have Breezehome in Whiterun. Storage for weapons and armor is not as extensive as other AE homes.

Tuxborn players who play on Steam Deck will have some issues unique to that device. This page is to go over those.

## General device UI

<details>
<summary><i>How can I point and click on the Steam Deck...?</i></summary>
<br>

MO2 is not designed to work on a Steam Deck, it's a PC app. So if you're going to use MO2 on the Deck, you need to be able to do mouse clicking. To do this:

1. Hold down your Steam button on the left side of your device
2. Roll your right thumb over the right trackpad to get a pointer
3. Use your right trigger for primary click, left trigger for right click (yes, this is reversed from what you might normally expect on a mouse)

<details>
<summary><i>How can I take a screenshot on the Steam Deck...?</i></summary>
<br>

Short answer: Steam button + R1 (right bumper).

Longer answer: info on how to take screenshots in Tuxborn, not only for Steam Decks but in general, can be found at [Frequently Asked Questions: Taking screenshots and Photo mode](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-Taking-screenshots-and-Photo-Mode/).

<details>
<summary><i>How can I customize button mappings in Game mode...?</i></summary>
<br>

You will want to do this once Tuxborn is installed, and you have a working shortcut for it in your game library. Do these steps on the Tuxborn shortcut, _not_ on your main Skyrim install.

1. Open the Tuxborn shortcut
2. Look for the controller icon over to the right and click on that
3. This will bring up a UI labeled "Current Button Layout"
4. Use this UI to configure whatever you like about your button mappings
5. Things to check in the Quick Settings section:
    * Toggle "Enable Back Grip Buttons" to on if it's not already on, to make sure you can use your back buttons
    * Back buttons will be mapped to X, Y, A, and B by default but you can change them to whatever you like by clicking on them, or by using the gear icons to the right of each one

## Installing Tuxborn

### "The game hung while I was trying to launch during install, how can I force quit it?"

<details>
<summary><i>If you're in Game mode...</i></summary>
<br>

1. Hit the Steam button on the left side of your device
2. This should load a menu for you that'll be showing options specific to the running game, including "Exit game"
3. Select "Exit game" to force quit
4. You'll be warned that any unsaved data will be lost, but in this scenario that's okay, go ahead and do that
5. You should return to the Home screen
</details>

### If you're in Desktop mode

If you launch Tuxborn in Desktop mode, force quitting it is a little harder, but it's still doable. It takes a little bit of preliminary work, though. What you'll need to do depends on where exactly you are in installing Tuxborn and what you want to do.

#### Quitting out of MO2

MO2 doesn't take up the whole screen, so you can just click on the X button in its top right corner to exit. Or, if you see the Steam window, you can click on the Stop button to exit as well.

#### Quitting out of Tuxborn once it launches

Once the game actually comes up it'll be full screen on the Deck, so you won't have an obvious thing to click on to kill it. So what you'll have to do at this point is where the prep work comes in.

The first big problem here is that while you _can_ 

[This Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/xntl1n/how_to_exit_a_game_in_desktop_mode/) has some suggestions to try. Of the things suggested there, we recommend the Alt+F4 option. If you have a Bluetooth keyboard already paired with your device, Alt+F4 will close whatever the current running task is.

If you do _not_ have a paired keyboard, then you can do as the Reddit thread suggests, and set up a controller mapping for one of your back buttons that will send Alt+F4 for you. The steps to do this are as follows:

1. Open Steam in Desktop mode
2. Go to Steam menu and select Settings
3. When the Steam Setting dialog box comes up, scroll down to Controller settings
4. Under Non-Game Controller Layouts, you should see a "Desktop Layout" section, edit that to map stuff for your use in Desktop mode.
5. This will load a "Current Button Layout" UI
6. Under "Quick Settings", you should see a toggle for "Enable Back Grip Buttons". If that isn't already on, toggle it on
7. Your back buttons should now be mappable, and they'll be mapped to your X, Y, A, and B buttons by default
8. Pick whichever one you want to change, and click right on the button mapping for it
9. This loads a UI where you can change the mapping, click on the "Keyboard" option at the top
10. When you see the Keyboard UI come up, click on either of the displayed Alt keys
11. This makes "Alt" your primary button sent by that control, but you're not done yet!
12. You should now be back on the "Current Button Layout" screen
13. Click on the gear icon immediately to the right of the button you just mapped
14. Click "Add sub command" on the menu that comes up
15. You'll come back to the Keyboard UI described above, now on that, click on the F4 button

Result: hitting that newly mapped button should now send Alt+F4 in Desktop mode.



## Console

The Skyrim console is known to crash on Steam Deck if you try to interact with it using the touchscreen. This is not a thing Tuxborn can fix.

However, there are multiple workarounds you can try to still be able to use the console in your game. See [Frequently Asked Questions: How to use console on Steam Deck](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-How-to-use-console-on-Steam-Deck/) for more details.

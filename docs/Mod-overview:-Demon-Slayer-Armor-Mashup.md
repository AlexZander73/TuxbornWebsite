"Wait," you might be saying, "aren't the mod overviews for quest mods in Tuxborn?"

Correct! However, despite the name, the Demon Slayer Armor Mashup _does_ include a dungeon to run and a small quest, so we're including it in the mod overviews available on this wiki.

## "What is this mod about?"

Demon Slayer Armor Mashup adds a new set of gear to the game, and a dungeon where you can acquire it. Additionally, the final loot in the dungeon includes a large collection of Conjuration spells, potentially of high interest to necromancers.

## "How do I start the quest for this mod?"

The dungeon you need to visit is called Heroes Rest Crypt. It is down in the southeastern corner of the map, very close to Stendarr's Beacon, and to Fort Justice from the Meridia's Order mod.

Simply enter and explore the dungeon when you find it. You'll pick up a couple of minor quest objectives as you do.

## "What's a good level to run Heroes Rest Crypt?"

The creator of the Demon Slayer Armor Mashup mod recommends at least level 20. We recommend at least 30, on the grounds that Tuxborn is more difficult than regular Skyrim. You may or may not get away with a level between 20 and 30, depending on what level of difficulty you're playing at, and if you have a large squad of followers.

## "What followers should I bring to Heroes Rest Crypt?"

There are no constraints against any particular type of follower. Given that you'll be running into a bunch of draugr mobs, at least one tank-type follower would be good. Ranged fighters may also be good. So for best results, consider Gore, Lydia, or Auri.

Mages that can do fire attacks may work against the draugr, but be careful with that, as mage followers risk hitting other followers in your group by accident. This approach may work best if your only follower is a Destruction mage. Lucien could work for this, but also Xelzaz.

Xelzaz could also be entertaining here in that he _is_ a necromancer, and could in fact raise a bunch of the draugr to fight for him (and you). So that's a strategy worth considering. Likewise, if you visit this dungeon while running Dawnguard, Serana could pull this off too.

And, if you bring Lydia + a Destruction mage into this dungeon, you might want to use Lydia's mod's MCM to set her Essential to make sure she's not accidentally torched.

A follower capable of delivering healing might also be a good idea. Lucien can be trained beforehand to do this, but an even better choice would be Megara, if you choose to run Katana and proceed far enough in Katana's related quest to also pick up Megara as a follower. Megara specializes in Restoration, so could be very helpful here.

## "What should I bring to run Heroes Rest Crypt?"

See previous recs re: followers.

Weapons enchanted with Sun damage would probably be very helpful, the most obvious example of which in our load order is Dawnbreaker. So you might wish to run The Break of Dawn prior to visiting this dungeon. Other weapons with Sun damage enchantments, however, should also be suitable.

Likewise, spells that do Sun damage would be useful. You should be able to pick up several from spell vendors, even if you haven't joined the College of Winterhold yet. Which spells you can use will depend upon what spells you're able to find. But consider both direct damage spells (Sunbeam, Radiant Sunbeam, etc.) as well as passive ones (Stendarr's Aura).

## "What armor and weapons are available in Demon Slayer Armor Mashup?"

As you might guess from the mod name, the gear from this mod is primarily an armor set. It's a heavy armor set that gives extra defense against undead. It's designed by default for female characters, but male characters are not blocked from using it. If you have the gear set in your inventory, you can take it to any forge and adjust the pieces to other available options. (This would be why the Demon Slayer pieces show up in your forge menu, even though you can't actually craft them. It's the mechanism to let you choose which form of the gear you want.)

In addition to the armor, there is also a sword called Silver Fang. This sword comes in two-handed form by default. But like the armor pieces, you can adjust it at a forge if you wish, to make it a one-handed sword instead. Given that the armor set does come with a shield, you might want to do this if you plan to play a one-handed build.

Lastly, there is also a bow called Last Whisper. This bow's arrows are craftable. You can make the book for them at any tanning rack, and once you have the book, you can use that to learn to make the arrows.

Have a look at [the mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97731) on Nexus, to see several screenshots of the armor on both female and male characters.

All of the weapons do silver damage, so they're particularly good against undead.

## "Does Demon Slayer Armor Mashup include any player homes?"

No. Not relevant to the mod, since its main point is to give you gear.

## "Does Demon Slayer Armor Mashup include any new followers?"

No. The NPC who was the prior owner of the Demon Slayer gear is dead by the time you show up at the dungeon, and the only other living NPC in the dungeon is the boss.

## "What other custom content is available in Demon Slayer Armor Mashup?"

The final boss loot chest includes a large number of Conjuration spells. These should be _very_ interesting to potential necromancers, especially as some of them allow you to summon large groups of undead. All the spells involved are Novice-level spells, even the ones that include "Master" in the name.

Note the variations on skeletons that the spells allow you to summon. The spell tomes do not provide stats on these variations, but in some cases, you should be able to observe which ones are higher tier, and which ones are likely to be able to Shout, by their names.

The spells included in this mod are as follows:

| Spell name | Effect |

| Conjure Rusted Skeleton | Summon a Rusted Skeleton for 60 seconds wherever the caster is pointing. |
| Conjure Rusted Skeleton (Master) | Summon a Rusted Skeleton permanently<sup>1</sup> wherever the caster is pointing. |

### Notes

1. The word permanently is misspelled in these spell descriptions, a bug with the mod.
2. This spell shares a name with the Apprentice-tier spell from the Mysticism mod.
3. For values of "army" meaning, apparently, five.
4. This spell did not include the parentheses around "Master" in the name.
5. This description string is repeated multiple times in the spell description, and terminates before the period on the fourth. It summons a total of four Soul Cairn Knights.
5. This description string is repeated multiple times in the spell description, and terminates before the period on the fourth. It summons a total of four Soul Cairn Knights, effectively permanently.

## "What are some other recommendations for running Demon Slayer Armor Mashup?"

If Heavy Armor is not your thing, you could hand the gear off to an appropriate follower. If Lydia is still following you by the time you reach this dungeon, consider giving it to her! It would be a good fit for her.

If you run Darkend prior to running Heroes Rest Crypt, you can acquire some gear that would give you an edge in this dungeon.

If you fight with staves, or you have a follower who does so, a staff capable of doing damage to a large group of hostiles would be useful. Especially if you're feeling bold enough to try this dungeon at a lower level.

Take the time to evaluate the final boss chamber and set up a strategy. There will be a chokepoint you can take advantage of, where the draugr minions will pile up. But at the same time, try to take out the boss as quickly as possible. He is tanky, and will do serious fireball damage to you if he gets enough of a chance. You may need to let any followers focus on the minion mob while you work on the boss.

Timing-wise, you might consider swinging by Heroes Rest Crypt when you reach the point of running Dawnguard, since access into Dayspring Canyon is within a reasonably short distance of the dungeon. Likewise, if you are running Meridia's Order and get to the point of visiting Fort Justice, that would also put you within quick and easy range of the dungeon.

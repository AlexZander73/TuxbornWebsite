# Overview

If your Dragonborn is hunting for a place to call home, and you're specifically interested in the player homes added by the mods in Tuxborn's load order, this is the page to go over those. If you want to look up info about the vanilla/AE homes, look at the [Vanilla player homes available in Tuxborn](Vanilla-player-homes-available-in-Tuxborn/) page instead.

For mods where we have in-depth overview pages, their player homes are described on those pages. See the [Quest mod overviews](Quest-mod-overviews/) page for the list of those mods, or note the relevant links in the table below.

## Greenmore Manor

This is the player home available in Beyond Reach. It costs 40,000 gold, making it the most expensive known home in Tuxborn's load order, at least if you don't count the extra money to furnish out Fort Valus on Wyrmstooth.

Player feedback on this home is that it has a very high-class feel to it, and its middle area can be configured as either a luxury living room, or a combat room.

<summary><i>‼️ However, BIG CAVEAT AND SPOILER WARNING: ‼️</i></summary>
<br>

[This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/14h5zzd/beyond_reach_player_homes_spoilers_for_brs_main/) says that this home is DESTROYED depending on the choices you make in the Beyond Reach plot. Player LilBeee on the Tuxborn Discord confirms this.

So this is definitely NOT a good candidate for a primary home base for your Dragonborn, at least not once you finish Beyond Reach. While you're running that mod, though, it should serve very well as a home base if you have the gold to burn through to get it.

<a id="krovaxis"></a>
## Krovaxis

This player home is very remote, in Winterhold. And will probably not be appropriate as a home base unless you are explicitly playing a vampire, and/or a follower of Molag Bal.

If you're game to try it, you will get a marker and quest objective leading to this house after you complete the House of Horrors quest.

Once you unlock the Stone of Reprisal, the house is yours. 

As per the [mod's page on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34750), it has the following features:

* The vampire Elder Saaruk will inflict the player with Sanguinare Vampiris should they desire (Note: I made the decision NOT to include a Vampire Lord option to avoid conflicts with the Dawnguard DLC).
* Unwholesome Flesh will allow the enterprising vampire to feed without end.
* The Stone of Reprisal will allow the player to travel between the Riften and Solitude Halls of the Dead and back again.
* 3 custom storage containers (Cabinet of Curiosities, Embalming Station, and Ancient Weapon Cache) as well as 3 burial urns.
* 4 mannequins, 4 bookcases, 8 weapon racks, 1 bed (the Shrine Tender's Repose)
* All vanilla crafting including a custom smelter, enchanting table, and alchemy lab (Furnace, Shrine of Molag Bal, and Antiquitous Research)

<a id="shantafilibb"></a>
## Shanta Filibb

This is the player home available in the 10th anniversary edition of The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal, which Tuxborn includes in its load order. It has a selection of upgrades you can purchase for it at the emporium in Ben Arai, including an armory, smithing stations, and an enchanting station. The basement includes several mannequins and weapons racks. Design-wise, it has a mostly outdoor focus, though this can be problematic when sandstorms come in!

Its location in the worldspace for Gray Cowl argues against it being your primary home base, but it can certainly serve as a temporary base while you're engaged with the Gray Cowl plotline.

Additionally, there is a shack in Ben Arai known to be usable as a home prior to getting Shanta Filibb, if you need to.

<a id="annals"></a>
## The Annals

The Annals is a section of Apocrypha that you can claim as part of running the Tsatampra Xiros mod. 

It includes the following features:

* The Antiquarian, a sort of mini-Hermaeus-Mora you can summon to guard the Annals
* A spell that teleports you to the Annals and back
* A Lurker familiar
* A Seeker familiar
* If and only if you have the Oghma Infinium, you can get a +5 skill buff to either the Warrior, Thief, or Mage skills, and can swap which buffs you get around

Finding the Annals and kicking off the mod happens at the Derelict Shanty overlooking the Sea of Ghosts.

<a id="asylum"></a>
## The Asylum

The Asylum is the player home you can get as part of playing the Identity Crisis mod. As you might guess from the name, the mod centers on Sheogorath, and the house is appropriately themed. It uses a bunch of the same assets as the dungeon in the Saints and Seducers Creation, so if you've played that as part of the Anniversary Edition, the Asylum will probably look familiar. It is located northeast of Windhelm, at the Abandoned Stable.

You will be given a quest objective to obtain the house, but other things you'll need to do to complete the mod must be discovered via player exploration.

The house comes with all crafting stations, and an assortment of storage chests and mannequins. Portals can be opened from the house back to Skyrim, and you will be expected to open the portals as part of completing the mod. A fourth custom one can also be added for a non-monetary price, which you will need to discover as part of the mod as well.

## The Arcane Grotto

The Arcane Grotto (not to be confused with the Abandoned Grotto) is down in the Midden, underneath the College of Winterhold. It's added in by The Midden - Expanded. So if you're playing a mage build, this may be a good choice for you.

Taking immediate control of the place is easy, as you must simply confront and kill its owner. There is however additional plot mileage you can play through once you do that, and a considerable amount of area to explore. So take the time to do this, and see what you can discover!

<a id="tower"></a>
## The Tower of Eyes

This is the home you can get as part of running the Waking Nightmare mod. It's located in the Underkeep in the Ratway, next to Shadowfoot Sanctum. However, this house's theme is Vaermina. Which would suit a Dragonborn who explicitly follows that Daedric Prince, but any Dragonborn that does _not_ may not find this the most suitable abode to acquire. As always, YMMV.

The design of the house is vertically oriented, suiting its name.

Amenities the house offers include:

* Access from anywhere via spell
* An unlockable merchant at the entrance if you perform a ritual involving a black soul gem, hagraven feathers, and a bone hawk skull
* A brazier at the very bottom of the house that can grant you temporary fortifications to a selected school of magic, which requires the Skull of Corruption to activate
* A Pool of Reflection, which grants you aetherial access to the various Jarls' palaces, and which even lets you fight the Jarls
* A full suite of crafting stations, and assorted containers

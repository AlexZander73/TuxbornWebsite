Auri is one of the most popular followers amongst the Tuxborn player base. She is a Bosmer, and a devout follower of the [Green Pact](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Green_Pact). Players familiar with that lore, especially players of Elder Scrolls Online, will recognize a lot of what you can learn about her! Players <i>not</i> familiar with the Green Pact will still be able to pick up a lot about it just by talking to her, and there are also additional conversations about the Green Pact which will trigger if you're also using Remiel as a follower. And yes, this does in fact mean Auri follows the Bosmer practice of eating enemies defeated in battle. You won't ever see her do this on camera, but she <i>will</i> make several comments about this. Some of them are even jokes. ;)</p>

## Where and when to recruit her

To recruit her, you need to find her in her pod (a Bosmer-style house, grown from a tree). Her mod page says it should be automatically visible on your map, but in Tuxborn so far, this has not been the case. If you have trouble finding her pod, the nearest vanilla landmarks are Evergreen Grove and Roadside Ruins. Auri's pod is a short distance almost due south from Evergreen Grove, and it's roughly northwest of Roadside Ruins.

You can recruit her at any time, but for the best experience, try to recruit her early in your playthrough, so as not to miss out on her early reaction lines when she witnesses your first adventures as the Dragonborn.

## How to summon her

She has a summon power you can use to bring her back to you if you get separated from her.

## Best follower use

She is an excellent choice if you want an archer as your backup, or if you're looking for someone fun to run as part of a Thieves Guild playthrough. She is actively pro-thievery and will regularly whisper to you about distracting shopkeepers while she snatches goods. (She has an amusing thievery-related conversation with Remiel, for that matter.)

## Level of commentary to you

Auri is not quite as talkative as other major custom followers in our load order (such as Gore, Remiel, Lucien, or Xelzaz). But this doesn't mean she doesn't have things to say! She tends to quality rather than quantity, when it comes to her solo commentary.

## Level of commentary about main quest, side quests, factions, and mods

She is known so far to comment on major main quest events, as well as the Thieves Guild and College of Winterhold plotlines. Talking to Auri directly while running the Thieves Guild is recommended, as you'll get additional dialogue options with her that way.

She'll get particularly snarky in battle if she's going up against another Bosmer.

And Auri is one of two followers in our load order set up to have commentary about Vigilant. (The other being Gore.)

## Level of commentary with other followers

If you want to run Auri in conjunction with one or more other followers, her best conversations are with Gore and Remiel. She has a smaller number of lines with Lucien and Xelzaz.

All four of these other followers, though, are highly talkative, especially if you are running them with each other. So for example if you're running Auri, Remiel, and Xelzaz, you may find that Remiel + Xelzaz conversations will overshadow Auri + Xelzaz, as well as the high number of solo lines both Remiel and Xelzaz have to offer.

So we suggest pairing Auri with no more that one highly talkative follower.

## Some important notes

Her adherence to the Green Pact also means that she will react badly if she sees you chopping firewood in front of her, or if she follows you to any mill.

Auri specializes with the bow in combat. It's possible to get her to use daggers for melee fighting, but she will _not_ do that by default, and you have to explicitly set her up to do that. Otherwise, if she runs out of arrows, she'll start trying to punch opponents.

By extension, this also means that you have to keep her regularly equipped with arrows. Her mod includes a special crafting recipe for the bone arrows she prefers, which you can make at a tanning rack. But she will not restrict herself to those arrows; you can give her any arrows you have available. Just be aware that she has _two_ inventories, one for stuff you might need her to carry, and one that controls what gear she's actually using. Make sure you put the arrows in the right inventory.

As per the FAQ on [her mod page on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278), the way you do this is to take the dialogue option "Let's talk about traveling together" --> "Let me check your gear."

Also, if you ask her to use daggers in combat, she will _not_ use her bow. She can't be asked to switch back and forth between the two. So you'll need to choose which method you want her to use for fighting.

She can be romanced! Although be advised, it is not the wisest choice in the world to ask her to live in a house made of wood. ;D

Lastly, Auri is known to be missing audio on more than a few of her voiced lines. This is an Auri-side issue, not one Tuxborn can fix. So if you want to run her as a follower, you may need to activate subtitles to make sure you won't miss some of the things she'll have to say.

### If you run Auri as a follower on Solstheim

Be advised that Auri's ability to follow you may break if you try to enter Neloth's tower in Tel Mithryn while she's following. This could cause a behavior where instead of following you, Auri will start walking off in some other direction, even if you summon her back to you.

Dismissing her and then returning her to duty does not appear to resolve the problem, nor does the `resetai` command in the console.

So to be on the safe side, if Auri is your follower, ask her to wait outside for you while you go in to speak to Neloth. Then return her to duty as soon as you come back outside.

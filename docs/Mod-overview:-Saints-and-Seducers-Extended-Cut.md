This page covers everything you need to know about [Skyrim Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772) in the Tuxborn load order.

## "What is this mod about?"

It is a complete overhaul of the [Saints & Seducers Creation](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Saints_%26_Seducers) that's part of the Anniversary Edition.

That Creation brings Dark, Golden, Amber, and Madness armor to Skyrim, and also gives you a plot that centers around defeating two groups of bandits that are working for a mad sorcerer in Solitude's sewers.

The mod completely overhauls that plot, eliminating the bandit camps, and taking you first directly into the Solitude sewers... and then into the Shivering Isles. There will be much more involvement with Staada, who appears in the Creation, as well as the mad sorcerer Theron.

The mod's depiction of the Shivering Isles pays homage to their depiction in Oblivion. So you can expect multiple lore details from that game's Shivering Isles content to show up here.

Also, it includes alternate means to acquire several artifacts related to Sheogorath and the Shivering Isles, including the Staff of Sheogorath, the bow Ruin's Edge, and the weapon Shadowrend (which can manifest as either a greatsword or a battleaxe).

## "How do I start Saints and Seducers Extended Cut?"

You must be at least level 20, and you must complete the vanilla Skyrim quest The Mind of Madness, to acquire the Wabbajack.

Once you meet these requirements, then you should experience a small earthquake in Solitude and get an objective to investigate the source of the quake. This will lead you down into the sewers to launch the quest. The sewers area is _mostly_ the same as depicted in the Creation, but it has been altered a bit for this mod. And you'll have a different encounter at the end of the area, which will lead you into the Shivering Isles.

## "What level is recommended to run Saints and Seducers Extended Cut?"

20 is required as noted above, though you may wish to aim for 30+. Most of the hostiles you'll encounter while running this mod are basic mobs, and you should do fine with those over level 30. 

But in the Shivering Isles, you'll run into larger monsters such as Hungers and Scalons, as well as Thoron himself as the final boss. Thoron is a powerful mage, and can do strong shock damage, so unless you're prepared for that fight, he may be a little challenging to take down if you're still in the 20's for level.

## "What followers are best to bring to Saints and Seducers Extended Cut?"

Gore is our current only known follower in our load order to have commentary specific to this mod. So if you have him as your follower, he'll have some things to say about the situation.

Any other follower besides Gore is up to you. Any follower who can cast lightning spells or who's equipped with a lightning staff would be a good counter against Thoron. And in general, if you have a good squad, any other hostile in the Shivering Isles should not be too much of a concern.

## "Does Saints and Seducers Extended Cut have any displayable LOTD artifacts?"

Yes. Many of them are ported directly over from the original Saints & Seducers Creation, and include:

* All Golden weapons and armor
* All Dark weapons and armor
* All Amber weapons and armor
* All Madness weapons and armor
* Amber ore and ingots
* Madness ore and ingots
* Staada's helmet
* Thoron's helmet (called Madness Helmet of Recovery in the Creation)
* Arcane Blacksmith's Apron
* Ring of Disrobing
* Nerveshatter
* Assorted Alchemy ingredients, including:
    * Bliss Bug Thorax
    * Flame Stalk
    * Green Butterfly Wing
    * Purple Butterfly Wing
    * Rot Scale
    * Screaming Maw
    * Thorn Hook
* Mystic Venom
* Soul Tomato

In addition to the above, certain other artifacts related to Sheogorath and the Shivering Isles _also_ appear in this mod, and should likewise be displayable in the museum:

* Fork of Horripilation
* Ruin's Edge
* Shadowrend
* Staff of Sheogorath

Grummite gear appears in this mod as well as the gear types from the original Creation, and some of that gear will be displayable.

## "What kinds of weapons and armor are available in Saints and Seducers Extended Cut?"

See previous section: all Amber, Dark, Golden, and Madness gear from the original Creation appear in this mod. You should be able to learn how to make Dark and Golden gear just by running the mod's main quest.

Side quests will get you the ability to learn Amber and Madness Smithing. See the Side Quests commentary below.

The original Creation specifies certain conditions for your ability to make these types of gear, so here's how that compares to Tuxborn's load order:

| Gear type | Vanilla requirement | Tuxborn requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Amber | Glass Smithing | Exotic Smithing |
| Dark | Daedric Smithing | Mythic Smithing |
| Golden | Daedric Smithing | Mythic Smithing |
| Madness | Ebony Smithing | Advanced Smithing |

Grummite gear also appears, as noted above, but there is no known means to be able to craft that gear. We will update this page if we confirm otherwise.

## "If artifacts from other Creations appear in this mod, does Tuxborn disable those other Creations?"

As of Tuxborn 1.1.3, the Creations for Shadowrend, the Staff of Sheogorath, and Ruin's Edge are _not_ disabled. So players on that build of Tuxborn may find conflicts between those Creations and the content of this mod. This discrepancy is expected to be addressed in Tuxborn 1.2.

Known behavior as of Tuxborn 1.1.3, though, is that the note in the Retching Netch that would normally trigger the quest Put a Fork In It does _not_ appear. So you should definitely play Saints and Seducers Extended Cut to acquire the Fork of Horripilation and the Staff of Sheogorath.

## "Does Saints and Seducers Extended Cut have a player home?"

No.

## "Are there any new followers in Saints and Seducers Extended Cut?"

No. But it maintains the spell you can acquire from the original Creation, which will let you summon Staada to fight for you if you decide you need her. She will give you this at the end of running the mod's main quest.

(This is another discrepancy between the mod and the original Creation, where you have to use the Sheogorath-Shaped Amber and other items to create the spellbook at the Atronach Forge. You should not need to do this in Tuxborn's load order, and in fact you probably will not be able to do this, unless you skip running the side quest The Merchant's Masterpiece in the mod and keep the Sheogorath-Shaped Amber for yourself. Doing this is not recommended, though, if you want to still learn Amber Smithing!)

## "The original Creation has the Sword of Jyggalag. How do I get that in Saints and Seducers Extended Cut?"

The mod does not appear to allow for this without console shenanigans. It _does_ appear, but it is not normally acquirable by the player. We'll update this page if we learn otherwise.

## "How do I find the Fork of Horripilation?"

<details>
<summary><i>Where to find the Fork...</i></summary>
<br>

Info available on the mod page suggests that the Fork should be near the tree you're asked to burn down in an optional objective in the mod's main quest. There _is_ a fork sticking into the tree, but it is not accessible by the player.

You may therefore need to follow the CC Put A Fork In It quest to get the Fork. We'll update here with more info when we confirm.
</details>

## "How do I find Ruin's Edge?"

<details>
<summary><i>How to find this bow...</i></summary>
<br>

In Xedex, there is an extensive network of root tunnels. Ruin's Edge can be found in one of the final chambers of this network of tunnels.  In order to reach that room, you will need to unlock a particular door.

And the key for this door is on a table in the chamber where you'll kill the boss required to clear Xedex, so look for it there. It will _not_ have a quest marker.
</details>

## "How do I find Shadowrend?"

<details>
<summary><i>How to find this weapon...</i></summary>
<br>

The same root tunnel network you can access from Xedex extends all the way to the Drowned Ruins as well. Shadowrend should also be available in this same root network, and will spawn over a pool.

As in the Creation, you will need to fight a doppleganger version of yourself to claim the weapon. It will constantly shift between the greatsword and battleaxe form, so make sure it's in the form you want when you grab it.
</details>

## "How do I find the Staff of Sheogorath?"

Information on how to do this is inconsistent, but this is what we know:

<details>
<summary><i>How to find the Staff...</i></summary>
<br>

Hints gleaned from the mod's page on Nexus suggest that "Theodor Gorlash" has the real staff in his shop. It is _not_ easily accessible. You can _try_ to steal it, but suffice to say, Theodor will not take kindly to this.

You can also make an "Other Staff of Sheogorath", which requires three items:

1. The Other Eye of Ciirta
2. The Branch of the Tree of Shades
3. A Heart of Disorder

The Eye can be found in Borogrove, in a strongbox, in the same room as the enchanting table.

The Branch can be found in the Grove of Reflection.

The Heart of Disorder is a thing you'll find when running the side quest The Lunatic's Treasure, for Sees-The-Moon.

We will update here if we confirm a way in our load order to get the actual Staff of Sheogorath. Running the CC quest Put a Fork In It may still be required in our load order.
</details>

## "Can I still get the Manic and Demented Elytra Nymphs as pets?"

Yes! There is a particular Argonian merchant you'll want to look for anyway, for the side quest The Lunatic's Treasure. This merchant has the Elytra Nymphs, and you can buy them from him. Note that he has given them names!

Static displays will activate in the LOTD museum for both of these Elytra Nymphs, near the rest of the Saints & Seducers items on the lower floor of the Hall of Wonders. 

## "Can I still get the scrolls and spell tomes to summon generic Golden Saints or Dark Seducers?"

These may show up as sale inventory for both "Theodor Gorlash" at the Near Corgi Shop, and for Sees-The-Moon.

We will update this page if we confirm you can still also make them at the Atronach Forge.

## "What side quests are available in Saints and Seducers Extended Cut?"

There are a few, so take the time to explore the area. The playspace for the mod isn't terribly large, so it should not take you too much time to find them all.

More on this below in the recommendations section.

## "That corgi is frigging adorable and I REQUIRE HIM, can I get him as a pet? 😍"

Not in Tuxborn's current load order. Players willing to Rule 11 their load order can however install [Merlin the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433), which should have a provided integration patch to allow you to recruit that corgi as a follower. Merlin's creator says this is the intended canonical way to acquire Merlin if you want him.

## "The shopkeeper at the Near Corgi Shop is who I think it is, isn't he?"

Yes. Yes he is. You didn't think a mod set in the Shivering Isles wasn't going to have him show up somewhere, did you? 😁

Tip: both "Theodor Gorlash" and "Near Corgi Shop" are anagrams!

## "There are odd dark brown areas on Staada, is this a texture issue?"

You may notice a dark brown area along Staada's back. Ouroboros confirms this is a feature, not a bug. Staada is wearing a leather corset under her armor. It just looks very odd in comparison with her general skin tone, as well as her Golden armor.

You'll see the same on any other Golden Saints in the mod, alive or dead.

## "What are some other recommendations for running Saints and Seducers Extended Cut?"

This mod utilizes a _lot_ of the ingredients normally available via the original Creation, as well as ingredients that show up in the Rare Curios creation. If you're fond of Alchemy, harvest everything you see. There should be freely available ingredients all over the worldspace.

Similarly, look for hollowed stumps to harvest to build up a stock of amber.

For the basic mobs you're likely to encounter (groups of Exiled), note that some of them do melee attacks, but others are mages and will often hit you with Destruction spells. Elemental resistances are therefore recommended. Enchant your gear appropriately, or come in with a stock of appropriate potions.

We recommend you do all the side quests in this mod _before_ you kill Thoron. There are three different items you'll need to make the Staff of Sheogorath, and the proper staff enchanter you'll need to do this is in Thoron's final lair. You will _not_ be able to return there after you kill him, so you'll have only one shot at making the staff. See the section above about the staff for info on the items you need. 

When you're done exploring the mod space, go back to Staada and her Dark Seducer counterpart, Dylora, to have a final chat with them. They'll both have a few remarks about things you discover!

Tuxborn is not the only modpack created by Ouroboros. Emissaries of Tux is another, a modpack for Enderal, the total conversion mod that turns Skyrim into an entirely different game.

Github's wiki doesn't really allow for making multiple wikis on the same repo, so this page serves as an index for EoT information. Annathepiper is currently running an EoT playthrough and will add to this page as she gathers more pertinent information. We will specifically keep this page spoiler-free, since many of our players will not have past familiarity with Enderal.

## Installing Emissaries of Tux

You will need to install Enderal first if you want to run Emissaries of Tux. It's available for free on Steam.

Once you have the game intalled, then consult Ouro's [Emissaries of Tux readme](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Tuxborn/blob/main/EmissariesReadMe.md) for installation instructions for the modpack.

You can also review Omni's [guide to installing Emissaries](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Jackify/wiki/Enderal:-Emissaries-of-Tux) using his Jackify tool.

Steam Deck players in particular, if for some reason you can't get Jackify to work for you, then Annathepiper has a guide on her blog for [how installing EoT worked on her Steam Deck](https://skyrim.annathepiper.org/2025/08/30/initial-tips-for-install-of-emissaries-of-tux-on-steam-deck/).

## Recommendations for new Enderal players

Enderal, and by extension Emissaries of Tux, is overall more difficult than Skyrim, and even a little more difficult than Tuxborn at similar difficulty settings. So if you're totally new to Enderal, you may wish to start a playthrough on Novice difficulty just to give yourself the necessary breathing room to learn Enderal's mechanics.

Enderal uses Skyrim's engine, so it's really easy to assume that how things work in Enderal is the same as how they work in Skyrim. Do not make this assumption! It may be true a lot of the time, but not always, so just doublecheck mechanics to be sure.

Do not rush through the main story. Explore _everything_. Take the time to do side quests, in no small part because there are achievements you can get by finding certain things in the world, and you never know where those items may show up. And doing side quests will also help you level up if you reach a point of the main story where you're having trouble proceeding. If that happens, back off from that part of the story, and go do more side quests.

Enderal's leveling system is a notable difference from Skyrim. Look at the [Character Progression](https://en.wiki.sureai.net/Enderal:Character_Progression) page on the Enderal wiki for details on this if you want them. Players who know Oblivion or Morrowind may find aspects of Enderal's character progression system familiar, even though it's different from how Skyrim handles it.

Take particular note of what Enderal's wiki has to say about how you level your skills. Enderal does _not_ have trainer NPCs like Skyrim does.

Making armor and weapons, as well as a lot of other miscellaneous items, is still done at forges and tanning racks. And it's still influenced by your levels in relevant skills. But you will _also_ need to have blueprints in your inventory to make a lot of items. Be on the lookout for these as loot in the world, as well as items you can buy from vendors.

## Recommendations for Emissaries of Tux

You may notice a good number of mods in EoT's load order that come over from Skyrim, and in particular, several that even appear in Tuxborn. Some of these are craftable armor and weapon mods. In general, do not expect craftable gear from Skyrim mods in the load order to also be craftable in Emissaries. Those mods are there to make certain changes to the details of the world. As you progress through the game, the gear in question will eventually show up. We won't go into details on where here, to avoid spoilers.

An exception to this is lanterns. As with Tuxborn, you may find initial light levels kind of dark. Emissaries is running the same lantern mod that Tuxborn is, and you can make those same lanterns in Emissaries. You _will_ need a blueprint for the lantern type you want, but otherwise, making them will work the same way as it does in Tuxborn.

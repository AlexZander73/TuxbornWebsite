This page is a quick overview of what's known about recommended starting levels for various quests in the Tuxborn load order. We'll cover base game and AE content here, as well as DLC-sized mods.

All tables are sorted by required starting level, and then alphabetically after that.

## Skyrim base game content 

| Content | Required starting level | Recommended starting level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Main quest | None | 8-10 | We suggest kicking off the main quest somewhere in the 8-10 level range, to make sure you're able to kill Mirmulnir at the watchtower. Adjust this down if you have multiple followers, or adjust up if you're playing on higher difficulty levels. |
| Dawnguard | None | 15+ | It is up to the player as to when to launch Dawnguard. You won't get Durak looking for you to invite you to speak to Isran until level 10, but you _can_ start Dawnguard earlier if you wish. We suggest not starting it too quickly, though, just to give yourself time to level up enough to be able to fight vampires. |
| Dragonborn | 25+ | 30+ | In our load order, you will not get the initial cultist attack that will launch Dragonborn until you're level 25 and enter any town. You can start Dragonborn at that point if you wish. The UESP suggests level 30, though. |

## Anniversary Edition content

The Anniversary Edition of Skyrim brings in a bunch of extra quests. But the Rebalancing Anniversary Edition mod we're running adjusts a lot of the level requirements for AE content, with the intent of making it a lot more balanced. You can see what the requirements are set to in RAE's MCM in your game. We recommend sticking to those settings, especially for the higher-tier plotline The Cause.

Also, the Goldenhills Plantation plot is separately impacted, by the CC Farming mod. You must be at least level 15 to start it, and additionally, speak to the innkeeper in either Whiterun or Rorikstead. See [Goldenhills Plantation](Goldenhills-Plantation/) for more details.

## Mod content

In this section, we're covering most of the larger mods in our load order, with the exception of those that are considered end game content. (See next section for those.)

| Mod | Required starting level | Recommended starting level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Legacy of the Dragonborn | None | ASAP | LOTD has no level requirement, and can be started immediately if you take the Relic Hunter start for your character. It also provides multiple other ways to start it quickly. See [Quests in Legacy of the Dragonborn](Quests-in-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) for details. We do recommend starting it ASAP just to let you start filling the museum displays, and also to get you to the point of being able to run its various quests. |
| Beyond Skyrim: Bruma | None | See notes | Bruma doesn't have a hard level requirement. But given that by definition running it means going down to Cyrodiil, you should run this when you feel it's appropriate for your character to do so. This may mean doing it ASAP, maybe even pre-main-quest, _or_ holding off on it until you're done with the main quest. Content should scale with you up to a point, but just about all equipment available in Bruma is lower-level stuff, so higher level characters may find it too easy. Note: Bruma is a possible location for you to go to for LOTD radiant "fetch Auryen a random relic" quests, so that might provide you an in-character excuse to go down there. |
| Sirenoot | None | 3-15 | Sirenroot's mod page on Nexus says there is no actual level requirement for this mod, its content will scale with you. However, its narrative is best suited to early game players. |
| Carved Brink | None | 15-20 | May be challenging for players under level 10, unless you have a squad of followers. Aim for 15-20 if you're running solo or with only one follower. |
| Falskaar | None | 5+ | Falskaar has no hard level requirement, and in theory should level itself to keep up with you, as per its Nexus page. However, higher level characters may find its opponents too easy. So maybe target this as an early or mid game thing to run. Or, otherwise, up your difficulty level if you're finding it too easy. If you start it earlier than level 5, expect to get killed a lot by hostiles until you level up enough. |
| Midwood Isle | None | 20+ | Requires you to have run The Way of the Voice before it will start. Other than that, no hard level requirement, but the mod creator recommends at least level 20, as per the mod's page on Nexus. |
| Moonpath to Elsweyr | None | 18+ | Moonpath to Elsweyr has no direct level requirement, though it does require you to complete The Way of the Voice. However, we recommend you run it in parallel with the LOTD quest It Belongs in a Museum, which has a requirement of being at least level 18, and having 70 or more displays in your museum. |
| Clockwork | 5 | 15+ | Clockwork auto-starts at 5, but we recommend 15 or above, to give yourself time to get Journeyman Smithing unlocked (you'll want that for plot purposes), and to gear up appropriately to handle hostiles on your own, since Clockwork's narrative wants you to run it alone. |
| Moon and Star | 10+ | 30+ | Requires you to have run The Way of the Voice before it will start. If you've done that quest, you should get a letter from a courier that will start this quest. Recommend you hold off at least until level 30, however. Most of the mod is very easy to run, but the final boss will be a bit crunchy for lower level characters. |
| The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal | 10 | 10+ | Requires you to run The Way of the Voice, to be at least level 10, and to steal or pickpocket something. More TBD. |
| Wyrmstooth | 10 | 25+ | Requires you to have run The Way of the Voice before it will start. We recommend level 25 or above just because Wyrmstooth's main quest will involve large mobs of hostiles. You'll have four extra followers to offset that, as well as what other followers you might be running anyway, so you may or may not want to adjust when you start depending on your follower count and what gear you have. |
| Project AHO | 15 | 25+ | There are large mobs of Dwemer automatons you'll fight later in this mod's plot, as well as crunchy boss-tier automatons. So better to be level 25+ on this. Also, this mod's narrative expects you to be the Dragonborn, so we recommend starting the main quest to establish that, before you start Project AHO. Dismissing any followers beforehand is recommended, as AHO's narrative expects you to be alone. |
| Helgen Reborn | 20 | 20+ | Helgen Reborn is a multi-stage quest line, so no reason to avoid kicking it off when you have the chance. You can work your way through its content all across your playthrough. |
| Wheels of Lull | 20 | 20 | This mod has leveled requirements for the various stages of its main quest, so you could launch it but then do other things in between running its quest stages if you so wish. See [Mod overview: Wheels of Lull](Mod-overview:-Wheels-of-Lull/) for more details on the level requirements for the quest stages. |
| Beyond Reach | 25 | 25+ | No known level suggestions at this time. |
| Forgotten City | 25 | 30+ | Forgotten City's story wants you to run this alone, and we recommend this even if you have followers that can auto-port to catch up with you. You should probably dismiss any custom followers you have prior to starting this, or at least tell them to wait somewhere. Depending on what level of difficulty you're running, we suggest 30+. |
| Gravewind | 25+ | 30+ | Do not, repeat, DO NOT start this mod unless you are equipped to run it in its entirety. You'll be stuck in the mod space until you finish it. So gear up and plan accordingly. Custom followers will port in with you, but there's a part of this mod where they will get stuck, so you may not want to bring in any followers unless you have a guaranteed means to summon them to you once they get stuck. | 
| Warden of the Coast | 25+ | 25+ | The mod page on Nexus says it's balanced for levels between 5-50, so you should be fine starting this at any point after level 25. Mod creator recommends you _not_ bring followers, since its storyline will give you followers as it plays out. |
| Depths of the Reach | 30 | 30+ | Mod page for this on Nexus says required starting level is 30. Recommend maybe aiming for 35-40, as the final boss may be a bit crunchy until you get to that point, unless you have a large follower squad or _very_ good gear. |
| Tsatampra Xiros | None | 30+ | This mod kicks off when you enter the Derelict Shanty near Solitude. One of the very first things you'll do is fight a lurker, so you need to be prepared to do that before you enter the Shanty. Since lurkers are originally Dragonborn content, we recommend targeting this mod around the same time as when you're ready to go to Solstheim to run Dragonborn. So we're recommending level 30 or above, as that's the recommendation the UESP gives for when to run the Dragonborn DLC content. |

## Mods considered end game content

The Vicn trilogy is called out here in a separate section. Our load order does not have end game level requirements for these mods, you can start them as early as the listed required levels here. However, common wisdom in the Skyrim modding community is that these are considered end game content. So we suggest holding off on these until after you run the main quest, Dawnguard, and Dragonborn. Some players even plan these mods as the last things to do in a playthrough.

| Mod | Required starting level | Recommended starting level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vigilant | 25 | 45+ | First couple of quests in Vigilant are okay at 25+, but the first boss you encounter will be very challenging at that level, so we recommend 45+. Ideally, 50+. |
| Glenmoril | 30 | After Vigilant | Glenmoril will auto-start at level 30. You may wish to hold off on starting it, though, until after you run Vigilant, as that is the recommended narrative order. |
| Unslaad | 40 | After Vigilant and Glenmoril | Like Vigilant and Glenmoril, this is considered end game content, so later in your playthrough is best. |

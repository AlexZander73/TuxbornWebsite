This page is the overview of everything you need to know about Legacy of the Dragonborn. There's a _lot_ to know, so we put major topics under expandable sections!

What's covered here are general questions about LOTD. We also have subpages on the following LOTD topics:

* [Museum displays in Legacy of the Dragonborn](Museum-displays-in-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/)
* [Player homes in Legacy of the Dragonborn](Player-homes-in-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/)
* [Quests in Legacy of the Dragonborn](Quests-in-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/)
* [Skipping Legacy of the Dragonborn](Skipping-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/)

## "I've never run Legacy of the Dragonborn before. What's this mod about?"

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of what LOTD is about...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>Legacy of the Dragonborn has the following notable features:</p>

* A museum in Solitude that you can use to display your loot and artifacts acquired through the course of your playthrough, including places to display items from several of the other mods in our load order
* Its own multi-part questline, which proceeds as you fill your museum with displays
* Several NPCs you'll work with as the museum develops
* A player home attached to the museum, with a full suite of crafting stations, as well as its own custom storage system accessible from elsewhere in the game
* Bundling with Moonpath to Elsweyr
* An airship, the Dev Aveza, which you'll receive after running Moonpath to Elsweyr
* A wide variety of artifacts brought in from previous Elder Scrolls games

## "I want to run Legacy of the Dragonborn, but I'm concerned about its performance. How does it perform in Tuxborn?"

<details>
<summary><i>What you need to know about LOTD performance, especially if you play on Steam Deck...</i></summary>
<br>

<p>Legacy of the Dragonborn performance is a top goal of this modpack, and we have curated the load order with that goal explicitly in mind. It should perform well on all of our supported platforms, especially the Steam Deck. As part of our first formal release, we playtested LOTD up through 300 displays in the museum, and running the Night At the Museum quest. We're reasonably confident of its stability.</p>

So don't be afraid to give it a try! But also, if you do run into performance issues, please inform us, so that we can work to address them for a future release.

If you are a Steam Deck player, for best Legacy of the Dragonborn performance, we recommend that you choose the Tuxborn - Deck or TuxBFCO - Deck profiles.

You can _try_ to use the Tuxborn - Handheld or TuxBFCO - Handheld profiles, but you would be at risk of replicating the earlier performance problems if you do so. If and _only_ if you're considering playing the same save on your computer _and_ your Steam Deck, then you could consider using the Handheld profile on your device, since it's compatible with the Desktop profiles and the Deck profiles are not.

However, if you do that, we suggest that you restrict all action at the museum (and if you want to be extra cautious, action inside any building in Solitude) to your computer. Outside of Solitude, performance should be normal on the Deck.

Once pass the 400-500 range for display count, you may see signs of some smaller performance issues inside the museum. We don't know yet if this is a matter of Tuxborn needing more work in this area, possible changes introduced by the latest SteamOS update, or maybe both. Players who see this consistently, please report this to the #txbn-support channel, so that Ouroboros and Omni can track the issue and start working out the scope of the problem. 

In the meantime, try one or more of these suggested workarounds if you start seeing performance issues in your museum:

1. Try to structure any given play session so that you do museum business first thing. The museum does seem to perform worse after you do a long session of adventuring.
2. Similarly, consider cutting down the average length of your play session. If you've been playing for three hours or so, you might want to save and come back again later.
3. If you are running more than one follower at a time, consider leaving them elsewhere before you enter the museum. One of these approaches should work:
    * Tell them all to wait for you in the Explorer's Society guildhall
    * Tell them to wait for you out in Solitude proper
    * Leave them somewhere else entirely
4. There are three settings in LOTD's main MCM you may wish to dial down to minimum values. These are all under General > Visitor Settings:
    * Daily Tour Chance
    * Vanilla visitors chance
    * Idle Frequency
5. If you start to see issues in the Safehouse in particular, consider avoiding loading up the Sell Cart with too much at once, as that's one of the big performance hits.
6. Minimize the amount of food you store in the Safehouse, since the dining room and kitchen have dynamic displays that update depending on what food you have in storage.
7. The smelter in the crafting room has a switch you can toggle on that shows an actual fire. Recommend leaving this off if your Safehouse starts being cranky. Ditto for the lights and fireplace.
8. Avoid using the Outfit system provided in the Safehouse bedroom, especially the remote access option. The Outfit system does involve scripting.

## "Do I have to run Legacy of the Dragonborn in Tuxborn? What will I miss if I don't?"

See [Skipping Legacy of the Dragonborn](Skipping-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) for further info on this.

## "What player homes are available in Legacy of the Dragonborn?"

See the [Player homes in Legacy of the Dragonborn](Player-homes-in-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) page for more information on all the player homes covered in LOTD, including (but not limited to!) the Safehouse and the Dev Aveza.

## "What quests are available in Legacy of the Dragonborn?"

Please see the [Quests in Legacy of the Dragonborn](Quests-in-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) page for an overview of the mod's major and minor quest content, including how to launch LOTD in general.

## "What followers are available in Legacy of the Dragonborn?"

<details>
<summary>Overview of Legacy of the Dragonborn followers...</summary>
<p>All five of the NPCs you recruit for the Explorer's Society can also be recruited as followers:</p>

* [Marassi](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Professor_Patero_Marassi)
* [Eriana](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Eriana)
* [Latoria](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Latoria)
* [Kyre](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Kyre_Oldenson)
* [Madras](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Madras)

How useful they'd actually be as followers, however, is open to debate. At the very least, for RP purposes, keep in mind that all five of these people are in Legacy's story as _relic hunters_, not necessarily as _warriors_. They can and do engage in combat when LOTD's story needs them to, but it's not their main point. And stats-wise, especially as you proceed into middle and later stages of your playthrough, you will very likely be able to do better with other followers.

But still, they are an option to consider. Each of their pages on the LOTD wiki has a little detail of unique things they can do if you happen to use them as followers. In particular, Latoria is described on her page as a capable Destruction mage, so that might be helpful for lower level characters.

At least a couple of these NPCs (Eriana, Latoria) are listed on the LOTD wiki as leveling with the player, as well, without a specified level cap.

**BE ADVISED**: the linked pages here for Marassi and Kyre _do contain major spoilers for the overall Legacy plot_. Do NOT scroll down too far on their pages if you want to avoid those spoilers. Fortunately, you don't need to to see the info about using them as followers.

In addition to the five members of the Explorers Society, once you have 350 displays, [Marcus Flynn](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Marcus_Flynn) will spawn as one of the museum patrons. After you speak with him, you may randomly encounter him in a dungeon later, at which point he'll offer to join forces with you. If you take him up on it, he will then be available as a follower later.

He is fixed at level 25, so he would most likely be useful as an early game follower.

## "How do I get additional rewards via The Curator's Companion achievements?"

<details>
<summary><i>How to use the Curator's Companion mod to get additional rewards...</i></summary>
<br>

The Curator's Companion, the helper mod we have that adds a bunch of extra functionality to Legacy of the Dragonborn, includes achievements you can unlock for running Legacy. In total, there are fifty achievements. By default, if you unlock one, you will get 1,000 gold deposited into a chest in the master bedroom in the Safehouse, right by the bed. Certain specific achievements will also grant you special items, such as the Backpack of the Curator, the Blade of the Curator, etc. You can see a list of those special items on [The Curator's Companion page](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/The_Curator%27s_Companion) on the LOTD wiki.

TCC however includes a couple of extra rewards options for achievements, which you can turn on in the Achievements section of TCC's MCM in-game. If you turn this on, it will enable the ability to get _additional_ rewards for unlocking achievements. These can include:

* A perk point to spend on skills
* Increases to your Health, Magicka, and/or Stamina

The options TCC provides give some flexibility as to which of these additional rewards you'd like to get. You can choose perk points _or_ attribute increases, or both. And you can choose a specific attribute to increase, or one randomly selected.

If you want to be awarded perk points, you need to turn on the Achievements > Reward Perk Points option on the LOTD: The Curators Companion MCM.

If you want to be awarded attribute increases, you should select your desired option on the Achievements > Reward Attribute dropdown. Your options there will be:

* No Attribute Reward (Default)
* Increase Magicka
* Increase Health
* Increase Stamina
* Random Attribute

Increasing all three attributes at once is not an option on the dropdown, so choose wisely!

Players interested in taking advantage of the additional perk points should factor this into their long-term build planning. While you won't get perk points off of every single LOTD achievement (as per what TCC says on its MCM), this will still apply to about half of them. So a few dozen extra perk points could be a significant balance changer in how your build could work.

If you feel like the perk points would in fact make you too OP too quickly for your preferences, you could also consider focusing the achievement rewards on your attributes instead. Players with mage builds, for example, might consider this an opportunity to ramp up your available Magicka more quickly.

If you feel like either perk point _or_ attribute increases would make you too OP in general, then you should leave these options off.

More info about which achievements will offer what rewards can be found on [this article for the Curator's Companion mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5075%7C%7C) on Nexus. TCC considers this information spoiler-y, so be mindful of that as you click.

## "How do I use the custom skill trees included in Legacy of the Dragonborn?"

<details>
<summary><i>What the custom skill trees are for in LOTD...</i></summary>
<br>

Three of the custom skill trees you'll see in the UI are for skill lines added by Legacy of the Dragonborn, as outlined [on their wiki page for Archaeology skills](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Archaeology_Skills_(SSE)). The three skill lines in question are Excavation, Expedition, and Academia.

As LOTD's wiki says, you gain perk points to advance these skills by either excavating a [dig site](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Excavation_Sites), or constructing an object at any [Archaeology station](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Archaeology_Station).

LOTD's wiki page linked to above calls out what known mod dungeons will have sites as well, if the appropriate patches are installed. This includes both AE/CC content, as well as mods. The following AE/CC content and other mods should include excavation sites in our load order:

* Clockwork
* Champion's Rest (Umbra)
* Falskaar
* Gray Cowl of Nocturnal
* Helgen Reborn
* Konahrik's Accoutrements
* Moon and Star
* Runoff Caverns (for the Forgotten Seasons AE/CC quest)

When you get 5 Archaeology points, you will gain a new perk point to spend on any of the three skill trees. You should be able to do so via the following means:

* The Archaeology tab of the main LOTD MCM
* The booklets on the table in the main room of the Explorers Society guildhall
* The Custom Skills icon on the main UI, which appears to the right of the Skills icon
</details>

## "Why is my Carry Weight suddenly over 100K? Isn't that way OP?"

<details>
<summary><i>It sure is, but it's only in LOTD controlled spaces...</i></summary>
<br>

This is the Ease Burden feature of Legacy of the Dragonborn. Its general intended use is to make it easier for you to carry large quantities of displayable items while in the museum, so it'll take less time for you to display them as you wish. And, it helps with crafting as well, if you have all of your crafting materials in your inventory and you want to work for a while on creating replicas or other displayable items.

In theory, this feature is supposed to activate for all player homes. In actual practice, at least in our load order, it seems to only activate in spaces that LOTD controls. So you'll see it turn on inside the museum and Safehouse, belowdecks on the Dev Aveza, and if you find and take over Deepholme, there as well. You may see a message about it turning on in any other player home you have, but in those cases, the message will be erroneous. We do not have a known root cause for this at this time.

Also, be advised that this feature has been known to occasionally _not_ activate when it should. So even when arriving at the museum, whether you come in through the front entrance or go up the stairs to enter the Safehouse, you may see Ease Burden fail to activate as expected. We do not have a known root cause for this either, though it may be related to lingering LOTD perf issues in general. If you see it happen, you may be able to avoid the problem by following some of the same suggested performance workarounds we recommend for Steam Deck players. (See these further up the page.)

If you decide you don't want this feature active even in LOTD spaces, you can toggle it off in the LOTD Settings MCM.
</details>

## "Can I turn on CraftLoot in Legacy of the Dragonborn?"

<details>
<summary><i>Short answer: no. Longer answer behind the fold...</summary>
<br>

No. This feature cannot coexist with The Curator's Companion, and since we're using that mod in our load order, TCC explicitly turns CraftLoot off. So while the UI still exists in our load order to activate that feature, TCC disallows actually doing so.

The reason for this, as per the LOTD dev team, is that it can cause major performance issues since it has to be constantly monitoring potentially thousands of items. This is known to cause issues with TCC, hence, TCC turning it off.

You can get close to the same idea by activating the Stash Supplies spell on the LOTD MCM. This will allow you to pull whatever crafting mats you might need out of storage, if you're not at the Safehouse or on board the Dev Aveza, and want to craft something.
</details>

## "I've just come back from getting Auryen's initial three requested items, but I can't find a way to talk to him. How do I fix this?"

<details>
<summary><i>He's a wily old Altmer, that Auryen! Here's what to do...</i></summary>
<br>

What you need to do depends on how far back Auryen is behind the rope that bars entrance to the museum. If he's just standing right behind the rope, you may be able to jump around a bit and find the activator to talk to him that way.

If he's too far back behind the rope, however, this won't work. And since you won't be able to go past the rope yourself, your only course of action is to use a little console magic to move Auryen to you. (Note: if you're a Steam Deck player, the console will crash on you if you use the on-screen Deck keyboard, so use any of the workarounds described on [Frequently Asked Questions: How to use console on Steam Deck](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-How-to-use-console-on-Steam-Deck/) to get into your console.)

You will need to use two commands, as follows:

1. `prid 12124CFE`: This uses Auryen's refID to make him the active thing being processed by the console
2. `moveto player`: This should move Auryen to you, so that you can proceed to turn in your items

The refID 12124CFE is known to be valid for Auryen in Tuxborn build 1.1.3. It will probably change again once Tuxborn 1.2 is released, at which time we'll note that appropriately here.

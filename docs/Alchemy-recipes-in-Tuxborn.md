[Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130), the Simonrim overhaul mod we're using for Alchemy, removes a bunch of potions from the game, but also adds a bunch. As a consequence, this means many of the alchemical ingredients in Tuxborn aren't going to do the same things you expect them to do if you're only familiar with vanilla Skyrim.

Consult the linked Nexus page for an overview of the changes the mod makes, including what potions have been removed from the game, and what ones have been added. However, the mod page does _not_ call out what ingredients you need to make these new types of potions. So for the convenience of Tuxborn players, we're doing so here.

This table will cover not only base game ingredients, but also, where known, ingredients that appear in mods. We'll cover what vanilla potions have been dropped by Apothecary, and what Tuxborn potions replace them. Please note the following about this table:

1. Some vanilla potion types have multiple lines in this table, because they map to different Tuxborn potions depending on what ingredients you're using.
2. Likewise, some vanilla potion types not actually removed by Apothecary nonetheless map to a Tuxborn potion type, again depending on what ingredients you're using.
3. Vanilla potion types that have _not_ been removed by Apothecary are highlighted here in bold.
4. We are following the convention used by the UESP here, and listing all known ingredients that result in the given potion. You do not need each and every ingredient in the list, just two of them.

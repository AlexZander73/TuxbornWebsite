If you want to Rule 11 your Tuxborn install, no matter what mods you want to add, it is best practice to make a copy of whatever profile you're interested in playing and work from that, rather than the original profile. This is a brief guide on how you can do that.

These steps should be applicable to all platforms and profiles:

1. Launch MO2.
2. Click on the Tools menu at the very top of the screen.
3. Select Profiles.
4. A dialog box should appeaer that includes all Tuxborn profiles. Whichever one is currently active should be highlighted.
5. Click on the profile you want to modify, if it's not already the active one.
6. Click on the Copy button immediately to the right.
7. You'll be prompted to enter a name for the new profile, so do that, and click OK.
8. You should now have a new profile to add new mods to.

You may notice the Transfer Saves button as well. We recommend you do _not_ transfer saves if you have any active Tuxborn saves already. The reason for this is, if you try to apply new mods to existing saves, you'll run the risk of breaking those saves.

So if you're going to create a profile copy to add additional mods to, please use new saves to do that.

You should also leave the two checkboxes at the bottom of this dialog box checked:

* Use profile-specific Save Games
* Use profile-specific Game INI files

This will help keep the modded version of the Tuxborn profile as cleanly separated from the original as possible.

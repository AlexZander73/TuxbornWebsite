This page is the overview for [The Wheel of Time](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55404?tab=posts), which provides a follower and an entire questline to run.

## "What is this mod about?"

As you might guess from its title, it is related to the Wheel of Time books by Robert Jordan. It sets up a crossover between the world of those books, and the world of Nirn.

The mod provides a follower, Aviendha, based on a character from those books. It also provides an entire questline to run, which will feature several additional characters from the books, as well as enemies to fight.

## "Does the mod include spoilers for the books?"

Not directly. The mod page on Nexus includes the following note:

> There are some events and dialogue which are closely related to the books. At the same time, it has been adapted to work within the world of Skyrim. Go into the mod with the mindset that something which happens in the mod doesn't necessarily happen in the books.

## "How well does the mod implement characters and situations from the books?"

This will be up to the judgment of the player, assuming that you have in fact read the books.

## "How do I start the mod?"

The mod's quest will launch when you find Aviendha. The mod's default behavior is that she spawns by coming through a portal on the bridge leading into Riverwood. Our load order includes a patch that moves her spawn point slightly to the west, however, so that you have a bit more control over when you encounter her.

See [Follower overview: Aviendha](Follower-overview:-Aviendha/) for more details on her.

Interact with Aviendha, take her on as a follower, and the quest's various stages will start running on their own.

## "What level is recommended to begin the mod?"

Since it kicks off with finding Aviendha, there's no particular level constraint with that. In fact, finding Aviendha early might actually be beneficial to you, as she is an immediately available follower that you might recruit to help you take out Mirmulnir at the Western Watchtower as part of the main quest.

The various stages of the mod's quest do not have level requirements, so you should be able to play through them at your own pace.

## "What followers are best to play through the Wheel of Time's quest?"

Aviendha would seem an obvious choice! But practically speaking, past a certain point, she's not hugely critical to how the quest stages play out.

Other than that, whatever followers you choose to run normally should be fine.

## "Does the Wheel of Time have any displayable LOTD artifacts?"

No.

## "What kinds of weapons and armor are available in the mod?"

There will be a particular sword you'll acquire as part of running the mod's questline, and the enchantment on it is decent. You may want to compare it against other weapons you acquire to see if you think it's worth using.

There is no known custom armor included, though.

## "Does The Wheel of Time include a player home?"

No.

## "Aside from Aviendha, are there any other custom followers?"

No.

## "What other custom content is available in The Wheel of Time?"

There are a couple of new spells you can acquire. One of which, Aligning the Matrix, is one of the few ways available in our load order that can boost Smithing _and_ Enchanting. So if you're inclined to crafting, you might want to run this mod at least far enough along to pick up that spell.

## "Does The Wheel of Time include any side quests?"

TBD. Once you find the White Tower, there is dialogue to you suggesting some NPCs will have side quests for you. We'll fill this section of the page in with more details when we confirm.

## "What are some other recommendations for running The Wheel of Time?"

You don't need to be familiar with the books in order to run the mod, so no worries on that score. The mod does try to at least give you an overview of critical worldbuilding concepts in initial dialogue from one of its major NPCs, so that will help players unfamiliar with the books.

Players who are sticklers for lore may find the mod's worldbuilding support for the crossover between Nirn and the world of WoT a bit... lacking. Whether this is deliberate on the part of the mod's creators is unknown. There is, however, enough detail provided in the mod that players who enjoy lore can work out theories as to how exactly this crossover between worlds could work.

Aviendha and Moraine have certain details in their dialogue that hint at prior familiarity with Skyrim. There is one known bit of dialogue added to a Skyrim NPC that suggests that person is familiar with Aviendha's people, as well. These details suggest that the crossover is intended by the mod to be two-way. However, aside from Aviendha, no one in the mod has any interactions at large with the rest of Skyrim, and what locations you visit as part of running the questline will generally be custom mod ones, in remote locations. So interpret this as you will.

This page is an overview of ways to raise your Carry Weight limit in Tuxborn, or bypass it entirely with in-game methods, without having to resort to the console.

## Base game methods

The following methods from the Skyrim base game will still work in our load order:

* Fortify Carry Weight potions, including potions you buy, and potions you craft
* Generic enchanted items with a Fortify Carry Weight enchantment
* Riding any horse will let you bypass Carry Weight limits as long as you're riding
* Asking your follower(s) to carry things for you

### Base game methods impacted by other mods

Several unique items from the Skyrim base game with Carry Weight enchantments are impacted by the mod Artificer. See below for more on that.

The Extra Pockets perk from the Pickpocket skill tree has been impacted by the Adamant Hand to Hand addon. Again, see below.

The Steed Stone no longer provides a Carry Weight bonus, as the Standing Stones have been entirely overhauled by the mod Freyr.

## Anniversary Edition methods

The AE content includes [craftable backpacks](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Adventurer%27s_Backpack_Items), all of which will give you a +75 boost to Carry Weight. Some of them will give additional buffs as well, so they are good to consider for early Carry Weight booting, especially if any of the additional buffs work well with the build you want for your character.

The pets you can acquire as part of running Pets of Skyrim can all carry small amounts of things, if you equip them with a backpack. See [Pets of Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Pets_of_Skyrim) on the UESP for more info.

## Legacy of the Dragonborn methods

There are several things LOTD contributes to our load order which will greatly alleviate Carry Weight problems:

1. The Stash Supplies spell, which can be toggled on via the main LOTD Settings MCM as soon as you start your game, even if you haven't started LOTD yet.
2. Deano's Bottomless Pack, available via the Tools of the Trade quest (or just by finding it in the world if you know where to look). It gives you +200 to Carry Weight.
3. The Ease Burden passive which will activate in all spaces controlled by Legacy of the Dragonborn. This is only useful inside LOTD-controlled spaces, but it makes it much, much easier to carry crazy large amounts of items around the LOTD museum.
4. Rains' Shelter, like Deano's Bottomless Pack, is a Tools of the Trade item. It does not impact your Carry Weight directly. But like the Stash Supplies spell, it will give you direct access to Safehouse storage. So it can help bypass the whole question of Carry Weight nicely.
5. If you are fortunate enough to find the [Phantasmal Chest](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Phantasmal_Chest) (this is not guaranteed in all playthroughs), you can use that as a summonable container whenever you need it, once you clear out its original (valuable!) contents.
6. The Curator's Companion provides a spell which will allow you to summon a Relic Storage Container. This container is intended as a means to store any displayable items you find on your travels, so that they don't have to take up a bunch of your Carry Weight limit. That said, there _is_ an option in TCC's MCM to let you turn off that restriction and have that chest accept _any_ items. The option you want is Advanced Settings > Relic Storage Settings > Relic Storage Restriction. It is set to ON by default. Toggle it to OFF if you want to use this container to accept _any_ item you're carrying.

## Methods from other mods

### Apocalypse

The Apocalypse mod includes an Expert-level Alteration spell called Deep Storage, which will give you access to an infinite underground storage space. You will need a high enough level of Alteration to be able to cast it, though.

There are three possible ways to find this spell:

1. Buy it from Tolfdir at the College of Winterhold when your Alteration is high enough
2. Run Project AHO and get access to the two Typewriter machines included in that mod, which could let you craft a copy of the spellbook for yourself if you have an Sealed Alteration spell cube, and a filled Grand Soul Gem
3. It may occasionally show up in the world as random loot

### Artificer

This is the Simonrim mod we're running that impacts a lot of the artifacts in the game. For purposes of Carry Weight, the relevant changes it makes are as follows:

1. The dragon priest mask Volsung no longer has a Carry Weight bonus
2. Saint Jiub's Locket _does_ still have a Carry Weight bonus, and it is in fact increased, from +50 to +100
3. Thieves Guild armor pieces all have their Carry Weight buffs bumped, including your original armor, the improved version if you ask Tonilia to improve that piece specifically, and the final armor you'll get as Guildmaster
4. The Charmed Necklace you can get from the mead revelers random encounter, if you give the leader an extra bottle of Honningbrew Mead, has been bumped from +25 to +50
5. The Black Book Filament and Filigree on Solstheim will now give you +50 to Carry Weight if you choose the power Secret of Strength

### Glenmoril

There are two items you can buy from the vendor at the Roadside Ruins that include Carry Weight buffs as part of their enchantments: Hircine's Helmet and the Mask of Hircine. You can buy these items as soon as the vendor spawns, you do _not_ have to start Glenmoril. But he won't spawn until you're level 30.

These items can be disenchanted! So if you don't want to wear those specific items, you can still learn their enchantments and apply them to any other items that will take them. Each one includes a Carry Weight bump as part of its enchantment, along with boosting your Magicka, Stamina, and Health regeneration. So they're very valuable enchantments to put onto any items that can take them.

See the [Mod overview: Glenmoril](Mod-overview:-Glenmoril/) page for more information. Look in the Light Armor section specifically.

### Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon

This mod merges the Pickpocket and Lockpicking skill trees into a single Security skill tree. As part of that change, the Extra Pockets perk in Pickpocket from the base game has been replaced with the Deep Pockets perk in Security.

Deep Pockets has two tiers you can drop perk points on. Tier 1 gets you +50 to Carry Weight. Tier 2 is +100.

### Mannaz

The Mannaz mod changes racial buffs around for all characters, and for Nords in particular, it adds extra passives all Nords can get off of the various Standing Stones on Solstheim. One of the passives it offers is +100 to Carry Weight.

This is therefore probably not feasible in the early parts of a playthrough, for the vast majority of players. Playing a Nord and taking the Left for Dead Alternate Start option _might_ spawn you on Solstheim. But this is not guaranteed. So Nords will basically have to hold off getting this passive until you run the Dragonborn DLC.

### Seasoned Traveller Armor

This armor set is craftable early in the game at any forge, and the items you can make from it include backpacks that give you +100 to Carry Weight. This makes them a very good option for an early boost to your Carry Weight. Plus, they can come in a few different colors.

We recommend making one of these as the superior option over the AE backpacks, unless one of the additional buffs on an AE backpack appeals to you more for your character.

### Simplest Horses

While horses are a base game/AE thing, horse functionality is expanded a bit via the horse mod we're running, Simplest Horses.

You can use this mod's hotkey, H, to do several things with a horse, including accessing its saddlebag so that you can give it things to carry for you. If you do this, just remember your horse has the items! It's very easy to lose track of things if you give them to your horse and then forget you did so later.

See [Frequently Asked Questions: Horses and other mounts](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-Horses-and-other-mounts/) for more info.

### Various mods that add cloaks

While cloaks are not broadly available in our load order, we are running a few mods that include them, so with a little bit of effort you can easily get one. This is relevant to Carry Weight because cloaks _can_ be enchanted, and they can take Fortify Carry Weight enchantments.

Some ways you can get a cloak include:

* From any dead guard, as many hold guards will be wearing cloaks from the Sons of Skyrim mod
    * Guaranteed dead guards can be found at Shor's Watchtower, and they are likely to be wearing Rift cloaks
    * Guards will also be likely to die during any dragon attack on a city or town
* Beyond Reach includes two craftable types of cloak that you can make at any tanning rack:
    * A basic brown Guard Cloak
    * A green cloak called Madoc's Mantle

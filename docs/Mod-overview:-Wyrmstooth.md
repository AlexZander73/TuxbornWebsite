Wyrmstooth is one of Tuxborn's biggest content mods, so this page does a deep dive on everything you'll want to know about it.

## "What is Wyrmstooth about?"

This mod gives you the mission to hunt down a dragon that's become a serious problem for the East Empire Shipping Company. Its intro quest takes place in Skyrim proper, but the majority of its action is set on the island of Wyrmstooth, in the Sea of Ghosts. You'll be asked to team up with four mercenaries to hunt down and dispatch the dragon.

## "How do I start Wyrmstooth?"

Wyrmstooth auto-launches, but you need to fulfill two requirements first:

1. You must be level 10 or higher
2. You must complete The Way of the Voice

Once these requirements are met, you'll be met by a messenger asking you to meet with Lurius Liore at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun. He is the representative of the East Empire Shipping Company who's decided to approach you, the Dragonborn, as his best shot at taking down the dragon.

When you speak to Lurius, be sure to play through all of his dialogue options, especially the one where you ask him why he's hiring mercenaries. That one will lead him to give you a description of the four mercenaries you'll be working with, and after that, you should get the objective to proceed to find the mercenaries and begin your hunt.

## "What level is recommended to begin Wyrmstooth?"

The hard requirement is 10 to start, but trying to start it that early may be pushing it. Unless you explicitly tell the mercenaries to stand down (which is a thing you can do), they will be your combat support throughout the mod's main quest. So that'll take some of the heat off of you, if you're still fairly low-leveled. But even so, you may find yourself hard-pressed to keep up in combat on Wyrmstooth under level 20.

Level 25+ might be a better target to shoot for.

## "What followers are best to bring to Wyrmstooth?"

If you're already inclined to run a squad anyway, be aware that since you'll have the four mercenaries as well, that may make your squad too large to be practical. So you'll need to make a judgment call as to how many of your own followers to bring, and whether you want to focus on having your own followers vs. using the provided mercenaries.

If you haven't played Wyrmstooth before, we recommend running it with the mercenaries just to introduce yourself to the characters, and no more than one or two other followers from the mainland. Try not to have too big a follower squad, otherwise you may find you'll just follow your followers and not get to do much direct combat yourself. Also, you'll run the risk of followers provoking each other, and maybe even killing each other, in the event of friendly fire. As per the Wyrmstooth official guide PDF, the mercenaries are set Essential. But any other followers you bring in _might not be_, so plan wisely.

Lydia and Xelzaz both have Wyrmstooth-specific commentary, so they would be excellent choices for followers to bring with you from the mainland. But if you bring Lydia in, because of the aforementioned friendly fire issue, it might be a good idea to use her MCM option to set her Essential. The mercenaries _do_ include a Destruction mage!

## "What followers are available in Wyrmstooth?"

The aforementioned mercenaries are the primary ones. Once you complete the Wyrmstooth main quest, if you decide you like any of the mercenaries enough to have them as regular followers, each of them has a personal side quest you can run. The side quests will unlock the ability to use them as personal followers through the rest of your game.

There is also an animal follower available if you run the relevant side quest.

## "What armor and weapons are available in Wyrmstooth?"

This mod doesn't have much in the way of full sets of armor or unique weapons you'll want to use. There _are_ several unique weapons and shields you'll want to look for just because they are displayable in the Legacy of the Dragonborn museum, but these will mostly be useful as display items.

The list of these items can be found on the LOTD wiki page for the [Wyrmstooth room in the Hall of Oddities](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Wyrmstooth_Room_(Hall_of_Oddities)).

## "Does Wyrmstooth have any player homes?"

Yes. Fort Valus is the primary one. It is available via a simple side quest on Wyrmstooth, but it is also _hugely_ expensive. 30,000 gold to initially buy it, then you need to pay more to get all its upgrades. That said, its upgrade are _very_ thorough. It's a large space and you'll get a couple of onsite merchants, a blacksmith and a gardener/alchemist, as well as several guards. If you have the money to spare for this, it's another possible contender for an alternative to the Safehouse. 

It's also a possible good place to headquarter followers, if you have a large number of them, and they have AI that allows you to assign them to custom homes.

To acquire Fort Valus and its upgrade, speak to Lurius Liore once you and the mercenary team arrive in Stonehollow. Lurius should have dialogue options available that will let you buy the fort, and then buy its upgrades.

Aside from Fort Valus, there is also an abandoned Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary on the island which you could claim as a _free_ player home, but the Wyrmstooth guide warns that you aren't the only one who may have eyes on the place.

## "What other custom content is available in Wyrmstooth?"

The mod offers several new spells, which you should be able to find as loot in various places. And there is a new Shout as well, the Word Walls for which you should be able to find while doing side quests all over the island.

Wyrmstooth is one of two mods that offers a custom Cure Disease spell, so that one in particular is of interest, since it will serve to cure the debuff from Shades of Mortality.

## "What side quests are available in Wyrmstooth?"

Like Solstheim in the Dragonborn DLC, Wyrmstooth has a main quest line, but it also has several side quests, as noted above. Thoroughly explore the island, and you'll be able to find these quests. We recommend you consider doing this after you finish Wyrmstooth's main quest, though, for RP purposes.

There is a bulletin board in Stonehollow that'll have notices posted on it. This is a good place to start to launch side quests. Some of the side quests, however, will _not_ have an obvious way to start them! So it's a good idea to thoroughly explore everything, just to pick up on any of the stuff that doesn't have obvious quest markers.

## "I found something called wyrmstone while running Wyrmstooth. Can I do anything with this?"

No. Wyrmstone is a holdover from earlier versions of the mod, when it was a custom ore you could find on the island and use to make custom gear. The mine that used to contain wyrmstone has since been changed to contain orichalcum.

Brimstone was another custom ore previously available, but that too has been removed.

The mod creator has said on Nexus that if he's able to implement custom weapons and armor using these two materials, he'll reintroduce them to the mod. For now, though, wyrmstone is not useful, even though a couple of pieces of it are still lying around Wyrmstooth Barrow. So you can ignore those two pieces, or, if you just want them as mementos for visiting the island, grab them for that.

## "Why can't I fast travel back to Skyrim from Wyrmstooth?"

Earlier builds of Tuxborn have had an issue with the fast travel map marker to return to Skyrim not being immediately visible. It is supposed to be available along the western side of the Wyrmstooth map.

If you see this issue occur in Tuxborn's current build, it will block you from fast traveling back to the Skyrim mainland. And if you come in on the Dev Aveza, it will likewise block the Dev Aveza from returning, as you need fast travel markers for the airship to work.

There are a couple of immediate ways you can deal with this:

1. Return to the Imperial dock which is your first landing point on the island. There, you should be able to find the Red Wave waiting, and you can take the ship back to Solitude.
2. You can use the console command `tcl` to temporarily turn off collision, and go out across the water from Wyrmstooth's western shore to find that fast travel marker and mark it as discovered. It _is_ there, it's just not discovered, and therefore not visible on your map. So if you go to the specific spot where the fast travel marker is present, you can discover it and solve this problem. Then return to the island's shore and turn collision back on by a second use of the `tcl` command.

If you are unable for whatever reason to use your console (e.g., you're a Steam Deck player and you don't have an external keyboard available for your Deck), then just be mindful that you have to travel to and from the island via the Red Wave. Or, use any of the options on the [Means of teleportation in Tuxborn](Means-of-teleportation-in-Tuxborn/) page.

You can still come in on the Dev Aveza, but if you have to leave the island via any other means, you'll need to go to the Safehouse and use the ship in a bottle on the mantelpiece over the fireplace to bring the airship back to its dock at the museum. Or, if you acquire Picky's Beacon and Resonator, you can use those to call the airship back to you once you're back in Skyrim.

## "Where can I find out more about Wyrmstooth?"

There is not an official wiki for it, but the TES Mods wiki has a [page for it](https://tes-mods.fandom.com/wiki/Wyrmstooth) that gives an overview of the quests and locations on the island.

The mod creator also wrote up a PDF that's a full guide to the mod. [A shorter version of this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/2999), which includes a walkthrough of the main quest, is available on the Articles tab of the mod's page on Nexus.

[The full official guide PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18nDoQaEcOK715jETPnD6JwN_5_7gIlfz/view) is available via Google Drive. Note that this guide is not 100 percent current; it lacks at least one known side quest present in the mod's most recent build. But the guide is still _mostly_ current, and its walkthrough of the main quest is still the most definitive guide to follow if you need help with it.

Note also that the TES Mods wiki page for Wyrmstooth contradicts the official guide PDF in a couple of places, such as with the name of the intro quest. In any such conflicts, consider the official guide PDF the definitive word.

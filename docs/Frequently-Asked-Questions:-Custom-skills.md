This page covers information about how custom skill trees work in Tuxborn. These are the various additional skill trees you see in the game when you click on the Custom Skills icon in the UI, to the right of the Skills icon.

## Legacy of the Dragonborn skills

Information on the three Legacy of the Dragonborn custom skill trees can be found on the [Frequently Asked Questions: Legacy of the Dragonborn](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) page. (Scroll down to [this section](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/#how-do-i-use-the-custom-skill-trees-included-in-legacy-of-the-dragonborn) in particular.)

## Lichdom tree

This skill line is relevant only if you're running the Undeath mod, since it comes from the mod [Prelude to Purgatory: A Lich Custom Skill Tree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53143), which adds the skill tree to [Undeath - Classical Lichdom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40802). That, in turn, is a bugfix mod for [Undeath Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180).

So have a look at Prelude to Purgatory to see how this skill tree works. In short, you need to be a lich to use those skills, and you level them by either capturing a soul, or by having a creature die near you.

## Insight tree

This skill tree is relevant for players running Glenmoril. It comes from the [Custom Skills - GLENMORIL](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45120) mod, and many of its skills pertain to the firearms available in Glenmoril. Accordingly, it will probably not be relevant to most players until such time as you launch Glenmoril.

Once you do, as per the mod page, you should be able to level skills on the tree with standard perk points.

This page covers the topic of how to get started in various quests for Legacy of the Dragonborn, including how to start the mod in general.

## "How do I start Legacy of the Dragonborn?"

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of how to start Legacy of the Dragonborn...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>You have a few options for this.</p>

### Relic Hunter start
If you want to do the Relic Hunter start, when you create your character, choose the option that has you arriving in Solitude by ship. Once you exit the starting cell and you arrive on the docks at Solitude, the very first thing you should see is a dialog box asking if you're arriving in Solitude as the relic hunter for the museum. Tell it yes. Then go to the museum, talk to Auryen, and get his initial tour. This will also get you instant access to the Safehouse, and a small quest from Auryen to get him three artifacts to get started. This small quest will give you an excuse to swing by Helgen and get the main quest underway, as well.

Note: you are not actually expected to get the relic in Helgen! Because of course Helgen gets torched by Alduin as soon as you show up. This is just LOTD giving you an in-character excuse to go there and kick off the main quest.

### Non-Relic Hunter start
If you do not want to run the Relic Hunter start, then any of these methods will work:

* You should see notices from Auryen available in inns, typically at the counter where the innkeeper will be, labeled "Seeking treasure hunters". You can pick up one of these notices to get the pointer to go talk to Auryen.
* Auryen will send you a letter directly inviting you to come speak to him, if you sell any museum-displayable object to a merchant. This is not level-dependent.
* If you're in Solitude, you can simply walk into the museum's front entrance. You'll immediately see Auryen, once you go through the door of the main building. You can talk to him to start the quest.

Note that none of the options for this path will give you immediate access to the Safehouse. You can, however, unlock the Safehouse once you have 50 displays in your museum. Also, these options will give you a variation on the initial three relics Auryen will want you to get, and this version will not include going to Helgen. So you'll need to go to Helgen separately in this scenario.

Choose whichever route appeals to you.

## "How do I launch LOTD quests once I am the museum's relic hunter?"

<details>
<summary><i>How to launch LOTD's overall plotline...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>A general rule of thumb for Legacy of the Dragonborn is, worry less about making its quests launch, and more about playing every other aspect of the game. All the rest of the content you'll play in Tuxborn will be the primary means of acquiring things to put on display in your museum. And while LOTD does have its own quests, those quests will organically launch based on how many displays you have filled.</p>

Auryen will be an initial driver of milestones you'll want to hit while running LOTD. A good table of milestones to shoot for, and how Auryen will respond to them, can be found on [his character page on the LOTD wiki](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Auryen_Morellus).

Overall, there are three major areas of quest content for LOTD:

1. The Shattered Legacy quest line
2. The three major expeditions you run with your Explorers Society
3. Much Ado About Snow Elves, which ties into the three major expeditions

And there are some side quests you will run as well, including:

1. Tools of the Trade, which gives you a map that will let you do a scavenger hunt to find several very useful tools
2. Night at the Museum
3. Shadows of One's Past
4. It Belongs in a Museum
5. Path to the Heavens

Lastly, there are some optional minor quests you can run, although these are definitely optional:

1. Finder's Keepers, which is Auryen's repeatable fetch quest for random relics
2. Research projects you can launch via the research station in the library
3. Building the Explorers Society research outposts

See below for more on these, and also, the [Player homes in Legacy of the Dragonborn](Player-homes-in-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) page for more information about the outposts in particular.
</details>

## "Why can't I find the random relic Auryen asked me to bring him?"

<details>
<summary><i>I can't find this thing, Auryen, what do you want from me...?</i></summary>
<br>
<p>When you get started as Auryen's relic hunter, once you run his initial three fetch quests, you may also pick up a side quest from him that will involve you needing to find a randomly selected relic, in a randomly selected location.</p>

The randomly selected location _can_ be on Solstheim rather than the Skyrim mainland, and even in mod worldspaces, such as Wyrmstooth, Midwood Isle, Falskaar, etc.! So if you get the quest Finder's Keepers from Auryen, and you do not see an obvious quest marker for the item on your map, it is very likely in a different worldspace.

You have two options in case this happens:

1. Hold off on finding that item until you visit the worldspace in question
2. Tell Auryen you're having trouble finding the relic, in which case he'll randomly select another one for you

Check the description of the quest to verify the expected location you need to visit. If you don't see a location specified, we recommend returning to Auryen to try again, as the location selection may have gotten confused due to it being in a mod area.
</details>

## "How do I do research projects?"

<details>
<summary><i>Because research is important to being a scholar, amirite...?</i></summary>
<br>
<p>Research Project is a radiant quest similar to Finder's Keepers, which will let you go hunt down a randomly chosen relic. To launch this, you will need to visit the Research Station in the museum library. You will spend Research Points on your project.</p>

To get Research points, you will need to read books titled Greater Research Notes or Lesser Research Notes, which can show up as random loot. They may also appear in the Museum Spoils chest in the Hall of Heroes office.

As with Finder's Keepers, if you do not get an obvious quest marker for the item, it may be located in a worldspace other than the Skyrim mainland. So you'll have similar options as to what to do:

1. Hold off on finding the item until you're in the necessary worldspace
2. Return to the Research Station so you can cancel the project (although you will not get back your Research Points if you do so)

And as with Finder's Keepers, verify the quest description in your journal to see where it thinks you need to go. If you don't see a location specified, the quest may be confused because of trying to target a mod location that LOTD doesn't know about. In that case, return to the Research Station to cancel the current project and try again if you so wish.
</details>

## "How do I start the Explorers Society guild?"

<details>
<summary><i>How to found your Explorers Society...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>When you hit 150 displays in your museum, this should activate a new dialogue option with Auryen. The dialogue option you'll want to look for is "Anything new happening?"</p>

Auryen will then pitch his idea for starting a guild with you. You'll get an objective to build a guildhouse, which you should do first. Once you finish that and show it to Auryen, he will then describe a proposed charter, and give you a list of contacts to find to recruit to the guild. Note: this list will not be given directly to you, Auryen will place it on the table in the main room of the guildhouse, where you're having that conversation with him. Read the list off the table, and that will give you additional objectives to go find those contacts.
</details>

## "How do I launch Tools of the Trade?"

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of Tools of the Trade...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>This is a side quest in Legacy of the Dragonborn that can get you access to a whole bunch of tasty useful tools, which are all special Easter eggs that are tributes to various contributors to the mod. Note that the quest is not required to find the items; you do not need to launch it if you already know where to look for them.</p>

However, since Tools of the Trade basically is a scavenger hunt, players not already familiar with it are encouraged to run it at least once to have the RP experience. I will not be calling out the specific locations to look here, to preserve a bit of surprise.

The requirements to launch this quest are:

1. Launch Legacy of the Dragonborn and sign on with Auryen as his relic hunter
2. Build the Explorer's Society guildhall, which you can do by talking to Auryen once you have 150 displays in your museum (see above)
3. Recruit at minimum Professor Marassi for your guild
4. Look for Kamahl's Map to spawn on the upper floor of the guildhall
5. Use the map to start the quest

LOTD's wiki says that you need to recruit all five members of the guild, but in practice, all five of them do not appear to actually be required. The map should spawn even if you've only recruited Professor Marassi. (It may also spawn if you recruit any other member, but if you recruit anyone else and the map doesn't show up yet, go find Professor Marassi next.)

The map will give you quest markers for all 16 tools covered by the quest, and a few of them in particular are highly recommended:

* Rains' Shelter - portable mini-home you can use as a tent, and which also hooks into the Safehouse storage. See [Player homes in Legacy of the Dragonborn](Player-homes-in-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) for more on Rains' Shelter
* Deano's Bag - green backpack which gives you +200 to carry weight, very useful if you're a loot goblin
* Picky's Beacon and Picky's Resonator - these two items will allow you to actually remote control the Dev Aveza and bring it to you, but you have to go to Solstheim to get both of them

More info on the various items can be found on [LOTD's wiki page for the quest](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Tools_of_the_Trade) if you don't mind the spoilers for the object locations.
</details>

## "How do I run It Belongs in a Museum?"

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of It Belongs in a Museum...</i></summary>
<br>

This is a side quest you'll get from Auryen once you reach these two requirements:

* You have to be at least level 18.
* You have to have at least 70 displays in your museum.

You will need to go to Elsweyr to find the necessary NPC, Rakis. This character will not be available until you run Moonpath to Elsweyr, however. So we recommend that you run this quest in tandem with running Moonpath. See [Mod overview: Moonpath to Elsweyr](Mod-overview:-Moonpath-to-Elsweyr/) for further details.

Running this quest is recommended, as it is a hard requirement for acquiring the Dev Aveza.
</details>

## "How do I launch Night at the Museum?"

<details>
<summary><i>How to launch the Night at the Museum quest...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>This is one of the milestone quests you'll hit as you continue to fill your museum. Night at the Museum will auto-launch if you meet the requirement of 300 displays in your museum. You'll know it's activated if you come to your museum and are greeted by a priest of Arkay when you try to enter.
</details>

## "How do I launch Shadows of One's Past?"

<details>
<summary><i>How to launch Shadows of One's Past...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>There are three relevant requirements to meet for this quest:</p>

* You need 200 displays for Avram Shazir, the new head of the museum guards, to show up at your museum. Talk to him for some relevant initial dialogue.
* Night at the Museum must have been completed (see above).
* At 400 displays, Shadows of One's Past will launch.

You will know this quest has launched if you enter the museum and find everything wrecked. Look for Auryen to be in a bad state in the Hall of Heroes office, or Avram in the front hall.
</details>

## "How do I launch Shattered Legacy?"

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of how to launch Shattered Legacy...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>This one auto-launches once you have fulfilled the following requirements:</p>

* At least 550 displays in your museum
* Auryen has given you the Sword of Ancient Tongues
* You've finished The Way of the Voice
* You've finished the LOTD quest Shadows of One's Past

The quest will start once you encounter the NPC Byron.

[Shattered Legacy](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Shattered_Legacy_(SSE)) is a major part of LOTD's content, and should be a considered mid-to-late-game quest. It'll take you a while to work through all of the necessary parts of it before you finally finish it off, but doing it sooner rather than later is recommended. Shattered Legacy does have several significant quest rewards that you may well want for the latter stages of your playthrough. These include but are not limited to:

* The full set of [Visage of the Dragonborn](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/The_Visage_of_the_Dragonborn_(SSE)) gear
* Access to the Dragonsoul Forge
* Use of the Ayleid Waystone, which will be useful later to give you access to the Ayleid Crossroads
* Access to Sancre Tor, which will in turn get you access to several significant relics, not only for the ones directly related to this plot, but also the Bow of Shadows

The Visage of the Dragonborn gear alone is worth doing this entire quest for, so put some thought into when you want to aim to do this quest in your playthrough. Because even if you don't use the gear as your final armor, it will significantly boost your ability to achieve the final armor you actually want.

One more note about Shattered Legacy: its early stages should take you to a fort at Pale Pass, where there is active combat going on between the Imperials and the Stormcloaks. It's not necessary for you to participate in that combat. However, if you're not running the Skyrim civil war and you haven't yet acquired pieces of the Imperial Dragon or Storm-Bear armor sets for display in your museum, you might find them here. Look for officers on either side as you're running Pale Pass, and if you have the chance to loot them, you might be able to get the armor pieces.
</details>

## "How do I launch the Explorers Society expeditions?"

<details>
<summary><i>How to launch the Explorers Society expedition quests...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>There are three major expeditions you can run with your Explorers Society, as follows.</p>

### The Excavation of Windcaller Pass

[The Excavation of Windcaller Pass](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/The_Excavation_of_Windcaller_Pass_(SSE)) has these requirements:

* You must have completed Dragon Rising in the main Skyrim quest
* You must have 400 displays in the museum
* You must have completed Shadows of One's Past, and have fully staffed your guild (see above for both of these)

When you meet the requirements, Professor Marassi should have a relevant dialogue option for you to take. So be sure to talk to him once you've met the listed requirements.

### The Excavation of the Ruins of Rkund

The second excavation quest, [The Excavation of the Ruins of Rkund](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/The_Excavation_of_the_Ruins_of_Rkund_(SSE)), should be available 10 in-game days after you complete Windcaller Pass.

### Trial of Trinimac

The final excavation takes place in the [Trial of Trinimac](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Trial_of_Trinimac) quest. Requirements to launch this are as follows:

* Completing Much Ado About Snow Elves, and its followup quest, The Visage
* Completing The Excavation of the Ruins of Rkund
</details>

## "How do I launch Much Ado About Snow Elves?"

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of how to start Much Ado About Snow Elves...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>This is a major quest you'll want to run in between the second and third excavations.</p>

Once you finish running The Lost Expedition, a few days later in-game, you should get a note from Calcelmo via courier. Read that note to launch the quest.

If you happen to run The Lost Expedition fairly early in your game (for example, if you're going to run Remiel and you pick her up early), we recommend holding off on this quest until after you've run the first excavation, the one at Windcaller Pass.

Much Ado About Snow Elves is a multi-stage quest, and there will be a point at which you'll get three objectives at once, to investigate Alftand, the Sightless Pit, and Irkngthand. We recommend you visit those places in that order, as you will obtain quest items at both Alftand and the Sightless Pit which you will need in Irkngthand.

The LOTD wiki has [a full walkthrough of this quest](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Much_Ado_About_Snow_Elves) if you need it.
</details>

## "How do I launch The Visage?"

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of how to launch The Visage...</i></summary>
<br>

This one auto-launches once you've fulfilled the following requirements:

* Completed the Excavation of the Ruins of Rkund
* Completed Much Ado About Snow Elves

You'll want to finish this quest as a requirement for running Trial of Trinimac, the final LOTD quest.
</details>

## "How do I run Path to the Heavens?"

<details>
<summary><i>How to launch Path to the Heavens...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>This is a side quest you can run once you finish running the excavation at Rkund. Once you have Karagas' Tower opened up, exploring that location should eventually lead you to a Dwemer schematic. Nab this and then go show it to Madras to start this quest.</p>

This quest will have multiple stages, through which Madras will ask you to gather a large quantity of Dwemer metal and scrap items, to use as part of building a planetarium inside the museum.

Because of this quest, we definitely recommend you build up a stock of Dwemer metal, scrap or otherwise, any time you visit a Dwemer ruin. Do not underestimate how many Dwemer scrap items you'll need!

And while Path to the Heavens is optional, it _is_ recommended. Building this planetarium will eventually unlock a way for you to get access to your skill trees to respec yourself if you want, very similar to how you can do so at the end of Dragonborn.
</details>

## "Is there a recommended order to follow for LOTD quest content?"

<details>
<summary><i>What we recommend for LOTD quest order...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>Initially, LOTD structures its quest content around how many displays you have in the museum, as noted above. But once you hit the last milestone for display counts (550 displays), where Shattered Legacy launches, everything after that does have a logical narrative order. So with both of these things in mind, here is what we recommend you do as a rough guide to playing LOTD content:</p>

### Early game

1. Get set up as the museum relic hunter.
2. Do Auryen's initial three fetch quests.
3. Build up your displays through the course of your normal play. Look for displayable items as you play other content, and also, keep in mind that you can fill a bunch of displays just by crafting regular armor and weapons at forges.
4. As you hit display count milestones, run the resulting quests. Weave these in between doing other content in the modpack as you like.
5. Do the excavation at Windcaller Pass. 
6. At some point, whenever your gameplay normally takes you to Markarth, run the quest The Lost Expedition, which has you explore Nchuand-Zel. This is a requirement for running Much Ado About Snow Elves, later. And if you want to run Remiel as a follower, you'll need to go into Nchuand-Zel with her regardless, so that's a real good opportunity to do this.

### Mid game

7. Once you hit 550 displays, Shattered Legacy should launch. This will be a multi-stage quest line, so you can weave this in between doing other content, too. Finish up as much of it as you can in your mid game, just because the eventual quest rewards are _very_ tasty and you'll want them before you really hit the end stages of your playthrough.
8. Meanwhile, run the excavation at Rkund.
9. Also run Much Ado About Snow Elves, and its followup quest, The Visage. Again, this will be a multi-stage effort.
10. Run Path to the Heavens, which will be available once you excavate Rkund.

### Late game

11. Finish up anything still pending from Shattered Legacy. Recommend you do this _before_ you do the final excavation.
12. Run Trial of Trinimac. This will be the last official LOTD content to run. Note: this is the point at which you'll find the cube for the planetarium which will let you get into your skill trees! So be sure to look out for that item while running this quest.
</details>

## "What happens when I finish running LOTD content?"

<details>
<summary><i>What happens with LOTD at that point...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>Once you finish running Trial of Trinimac, you'll get some end-game credits and a little cutscene. That's the official end of LOTD's storyline.</p>

However, you can of course keep filling your museum, if you haven't finished filling it yet! You can keep putting displays in for as long as you like.
</details>

## "What are some other recommendations for running LOTD quests?"

<details>
<summary><i>Daumbra and the Ruins of Rkund...</i></summary>
<br>

If you are playing a two-handed build, acquiring Daumbra via the There is No Umbra quest is worth considering when running the Excavation of the Ruins of Rkund. Certain abilities granted you by Daumbra could be very helpful in making your way up to the top of the magma silo you'll need to traverse as part of that quest, if you're feeling bold enough to avoid using the portal shortcut.
</details>

<details>
<summary><i>If you get stuck after rescuing Ezra during Shattered Legacy...</i></summary>
<br>

When you get to the point of running Shattered Legacy, early in that quest you'll be sent by Argus to go rescue Ezra from Pale Pass. Once you do this, you'll need to return with her to High Hrothgar.

This has, however, been known to cause buggy behavior. You may find that Ezra and Argus just stand at Argus' campsite just outside High Hrothgar, and you have no dialogue options to proceed with them.

Workaround steps you can try at this point are as follows:

1. Leave the area and come back. As long as you change zones, you shouldn't have to go far. It may be adequate to just go inside High Hrothgar, or, if you came in on the Dev Aveza, go belowdecks.
2. Then come back to Argus' campsite. See if Ezra has disappeared.
3. If she has, you'll need to move her back to you via the console. 

Once Ezra is back, the initial conversation between her and Argus should proceed and you can continue with the quest.

You will need to use two commands for the console solution, first `prid` followed by Ezra's refID, and then `moveto player`. As follows:

| If you are playing... | Then you need these commands... |
| --- | --- |
| Tuxborn 1.1.3 | `prid 1201B3B4` then `moveto player` |
| Tuxborn 1.2 beta | `prid 1101B3B4` then `moveto player` |

If this doesn't work for you on first try, some variations of step 1 you can try are to go somewhere farther away (down to Ivarstead, all the way back to the museum, whatever works), and/or for a longer period (maybe 1-2 game days).
</details>

<details>
<summary><i>If you see the side quest for Auryen's Notes: The Tools of Kagrenac not finishing even if you've completed The Tools of Kagrenac...</i></summary>
<br>

We have a small issue with the side quest you get off of the book Auryen's Notes: The Tools of Kagrenac. It will not properly finish even if you conclude running the Tools of Kagrenac mod, and it will expect you to still find Wraithguard.

This appears to be a known issue with the Creation Club patches for Legacy of the Dragonborn, and it has in fact been fixed as of version 6.0.10 of those patches. We are currently running 6.0.9 as of Tuxborn build 1.1.3. The beta build should contain the fix for this issue. 

Players running 1.1.3, you should be able to resolve this issue with this console command:

`setstage DBM_AMJournalQST10 50`

Steam Deck players, remember that you can use any of the workarounds described in [Frequently Asked Questions: How to use console on Steam Deck](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-How-to-use-console-on-Steam-Deck/).

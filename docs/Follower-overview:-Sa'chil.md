‼️ **This follower is available only in the Tuxborn 1.2 beta build. So all info on this page is relevant only to players using that build. Content here will be subject to updates as testing on the beta continues.** ‼️

Sa'chil is a Dagi-raht Khajiit warrior from Hammerfell, with a large store of dialogue lines and custom quests! More info about her can be found on [her page on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106892).

## Where and when to recruit her

Sa'chil's initial location is on the cliff near Reachwind Eyrie. There is no known level requirement for picking her up, so you should be able to do so at any time.

If you take any start out of chargen _besides_ the LOTD Relic Hunter start, and you then launch LOTD, one of the fetch quests you'll get from Auryen will send you into the Reach. At that point, you'll be within range of finding Sa'chil to recruit her if you want to do so. And in fact, you may specifically _want_ to recruit her prior to getting the artifact from Auryen! Because if you're going after that artifact at a low level, the Forsworn you'll have to fight will very likely kill you repeatedly. So Sa'chil should hopefully be additional protection against that.

## How to summon her

Unknown at this time if Sa'chil has a means to summon her. There's nothing mentioned outright on her Nexus page. We'll update this page if we find out new information.

## Best follower use

From what we've seen on her page on Nexus, Sa'chil is a spellsword, so she should be useful in both melee combat _and_ ranged magical attacks.

She has the abilty to heal you daily. Which likely means she may not be the primary choice if you want a healer in your party, but this could still save you in a pinch.

Her page describes her as robbing cities to give spoils to you, so she's likely a good choice for Thieves Guild playthroughs.

## Level of commentary to you

Sa'chil's page says she has about 6,000 lines, so she is definitely going to be talkative!

## Level of commentary about main quest, side quests, factions, and mods

Expect her to have a lot to say about the main quest, but also about the Thieves Guild and the College of Winterhold.

She is not known to comment on other mods at this time, although her page on Nexus says making her aware of Moonpath to Elsweyr is planned for future updates.

## Level of commentary with other followers

Sa'chil has no known commentary with other followers, though again, this is apparently planned for future updates. We'll update this page when we know more.

## Some important notes

Sa'chil has a help book that'll show up in your inventory as soon as you come out of chargen. This book is _also_ a skill book for Speech! So at minimum, open the thing to get the free skill point. But you may also wish to actually read it as well, to make sure you don't miss anything important about how to use Sa'chil as a follower.

She has several personal quests you can follow which have at least two possible outcomes:

* Ability to marry her
* Ability to turn Reachwind Eyrie into a player home

‼️ **Her Nexus page says the mod is _not_ actually changing Reachwind Eyrie's original interior; it's making a copy and adjusting exits appropriately to get to the new version. This is a thing we'll want to look out for in beta testing.** ‼️

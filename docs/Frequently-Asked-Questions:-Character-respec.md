This page covers the known ways to respec your character in Tuxborn.

## "How can I change my character's appearance in Tuxborn?"

As of release 1.1.3 these methods of changing your appearance exist:

1. The Face Sculptor in the Ragged Flagon, in Riften, which will cost you gold. She is vanilla content, although we are running a mod that alters her a bit and lets you buy two tiers of overhaul from her.
2. There is a machine on board the AHO, the Dwemer airship you can get as a reward for running the Project AHO plot. This machine functions very similarly to the Face Sculptor, but would require you to run that plot to get it. On the upside, it's free.
3. As a very last resort, the console command "showracemenu" will bring up the RaceMenu UI.

Lastly, note that using any of these methods to alter your character's appearance will _also_ re-launch the Pronouns mod, which normally only launches at character creation. Since Pronouns does allow you to change your pronouns mid-game in the MCM, doing so again here should _in theory_ not cause any issues. However, if you do change your pronouns at this point, please report any subsequent issues you see in #txbn-support.

## "Can I change my character's race in Tuxborn?"

Technically, yes. But you really, _really_ should not do so.

The RaceMenu UI, if invoked via any of the listed means in the previous question, is _supposed_ to not show you the Race selector. However, it still does. You can still see it when you cycle through the available tabs in the UI. Specifically, you will not see the Race tab header along the top of the UI; there will be a bit of a space where it normally appears during chargen on startup. But the actual menu is still accessible, and you can see it if you just tab through the various options in the UI!

We cannot state this strongly enough:

**‼️ DO NOT TRY TO CHANGE YOUR CHARACTER'S RACE AFTER INITIAL STARTUP. THIS CAN HAVE GAME-BREAKING CONSEQUENCES. ‼️**

We cannot fix your game for you if you try to set your race to something else, and anything goes haywire as a result. So _do not do this_.

## "How can I change my character's skills in Tuxborn?"

There are three known ways to change your assigned perks on your skill trees in Tuxborn:

1. Running all of Dragonborn will give you access to a Black Book that will bring up your skill trees on demand, and let you reassign perks on them as you desire. However, getting access to this Black Book does require you to run all of Dragonborn. Note that as per standard Dragonborn functionality, you do have to spend dragon souls, one per skill tree, to be able to change perks.
2. Running Legacy of the Dragonborn in far enough will eventually get you to a point where you are asked to help build a planetarium in the museum. Once you get far enough in LOTD's plotline, you can acquire a control cube for this planetarium, which will give you access to your skill trees as well. Disadvantage: you do have to get fairly far in on LOTD's plotline before you can do this. Advantage: does not require you to be on Solstheim to work. You just have to visit your museum.
3. Depending on your plot choices in Vigilant, you may also trigger a third way to respec your character. We will _not_ go into detail on this, because spoilers. Suffice to say that since this depends upon your plot choices, it is not a guaranteed means to respec.

## "Are there ways I can get extra skill points in Tuxborn besides the ones awarded on level up?"

You have several options if you want to get additional skill points to spend.

1. The Bards College still works to give you a bump in every single skill in your tree, once you run the quest Tending the Flames and bring back the three instruments for the Bards College trainers.
2. Paying gold to trainers also still works, as per vanilla functionality. Note that since we're running [Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191) and its Hand to Hand addon, some of the trainers have been adjusted a bit to account for the Security skill tree, and the addition of the Hand to Hand skill tree. Consult that mod's page for further details.
3. Vanilla favor quests are still worth running, to pick up skill points from citizens who can give you those. There are several of these, so pick and choose the ones you like the best. They're good to run anyway as part of picking up the thaneship in a hold.
4. [Malrus' Codex](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Malrus'_Codex) in Legacy of the Dragonborn, available as the quest reward for running the quest [The Book of Wonders](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/The_Book_of_Wonders), will give you a randomly assigned skill point for every 20 locations you've discovered. You can study the book once a day to do this. The quest to find the Codex is easy to launch and easy to do, and it's recommended for the early stretches of a Legacy of the Dragonborn run.
5. If you run Project AHO, any time you find a Dwemer Statuette and pick it up, it will bump every single one of your skills by a point. There are several of these statuettes in the mod space, so be on the lookout for them.
6. If you run Carved Brink, a similar Statuette (not Dwemer, just Statuette) will bump a randomly selected skill by a point. As with Project AHO, there are several of these statuettes all over the mod space, so be sure to look for them.
7. Certain side quests on Midwood Isle give skill points as rewards.

Last but not least, note that while the combo of the Experience and Static Skill Leveling mods in Tuxborn turns off skills leveling as you use them by default, Static Skill Leveling does include an option in the MCM to turn that back on if you prefer. It is the very last option in the Static Skill Leveling MCM, called simply "Toggle skill leveling". By default this option is on, and it means that skills will not level as you use them. Turn the toggle off to let skills level as you use them.

## "How can I get additional perk points in Tuxborn besides the one awarded on each level up?"

Tuxborn does not at this time include any standalone mod that allows you to gain extra perk points regularly, such as by trading in dragon souls. 

There are, however, a few ways through which you can acquire extra perk points as part of the functionality of other mods. These are:

1. The Artificer mod in our load order changes the Oghma Infinium to grant you two perk points. As per vanilla Skyrim behavior, you can get this benefit only once, as the book will disappear once you read it.
2. If you are playing a Redguard, then the Freyr mod allows you to take the power Jinniya of the Lamp at the Shadow Stone. This grants you the ability to make periodic wishes, which include the ability to pick up additional perk points. You can only use this ability every 1,001 minutes (16 hours, 41 minutes). And that's _real_ time, not _game_ time. So depending on how often you play, realistically, you can maybe use this power only once a week.
3. If you are playing an Imperial, the Mannaz mod allows you to get two extra perk points to spend to start with.
4. If you complete the main quest for Midwood Isle, two perk points are included in your quest rewards for that.
5. If you play Unslaad, that includes an NPC who has the ability to convert dragon souls into other things for you, including perk points. This does however require you to start Unslaad and find that NPC.
6. Last but not least, The Curator's Companion mod has an option you can turn on which will allow you to receive perk points when unlocking achievements in Legacy of the Dragonborn. Obviously, to take advantage of this, you would in fact need to run LOTD. See the [Frequently Asked Questions: Legacy of the Dragonborn](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) page for further details on this.

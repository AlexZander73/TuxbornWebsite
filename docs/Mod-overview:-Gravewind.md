This page provides an overview of the mod Gravewind in the Tuxborn load order.

## "How do I start Gravewind?"

There is a house called Cemetery Homestead within short walking distance of Auri's Pod in Falkreath. If you don't have Auri's Pod marked on your map, you can use the Roadside Ruins as a landmark as well. The house should be northwest-ish from the Ruins.

Enter this house to start the mod.

## "What level should I start Gravewind at?"

The [mod's page on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129582) recommends 25 or higher. If you come in over level 30 you should be fine, although some of the more powerful bosses may still kill you. So either go higher on level, or gear yourself up accordingly.

Do not, repeat, _not_ enter Cemetery Homestead until you're ready to run the mod. You'll be stuck in there until you're finished. So only go in when you're prepared.

## "Do followers work with Gravewind?"

The mod page recommends that you do _not_ bring followers. Gravewind won't actively _block_ followers from coming in with you, especially custom followers who are set up to port to catch up with you. But there's a specific area of the mod where followers can and will get stuck. 

So in general, we recommend dismissing your followers, if any, for the easiest experience. If you want to bring in followers anyway, it will help if they are followers you can easily summon back to you if they get lost. Methods on how to do this will vary depending on which custom follower you're running, but will generally be either a spell or a power.

If you're running followers for which you do _not_ have an immediate way to summon them back to you, your options are:

1. Find out what that follower's refID is, and use that information to move them back to you with the console. This requires two commands: `prid` followed by the follower's refID, and then `moveto player`. Or,
2. Do without that follower until you finally finish the mod. As soon as you fast travel anywhere after getting out of the mod, the follower should catch up with you again. This should include going anywhere on the Dev Aveza, as well.

## "What should I bring to run Gravewind?"

Since this is a mod you'll be stuck in until you're done with it, prepare accordingly.

If you kept Shades of Mortality active in your load order, bring whatever means of curing the Death's Grip nerf you have available to you. Some of the higher-tier bosses will be a bit crunchy, depending on your level. And there will be a platformer-type area you'll have to jump around a lot in, and if you aim wrong, you'll fall into tar that will kill you. So Shades of Mortality will probably hit you a lot in that area.

The aforementioned tar area, if you have trouble with jumping, may also possibly be navigated via the following means:

1. Whirlwind Sprint Shout. You can probably get away with having just two words of it. If you have all three words, be careful how many of them you invoke, lest you overshoot where you're aiming for.
2. The Wind Running Master-level Alteration spell, available via Apocalypse.

If you're running Survival Mode, you should also bring enough food to last you for however long it takes you to run the mod. Or at the very least, have food easily accessible via the Stash Supplies spell, or Rains' Shelter. Speaking of which, Survival Mode players should definitely have Rains' Shelter, as a guaranteed place to sleep, if you wind up taking more than one game day to play through the mod.

## "Does Gravewind have any displayable LOTD artifacts?"

No.

## "What armor and weapons are available in Gravewind?"

There is a set of armor you'll be able to get at the end, as well as the ability to make unenchanted versions.

## "Is there a player home in Gravewind?"

Not exactly. Depending on how you choose to play the ending, you may or may not retain control of the Gravewind play space, but it doesn't serve as a player home. See the mod's Nexus page for relevant spoilers.

## "What custom spells are available in Gravewind?"

There are several, again called out in spoilers on the mod's Nexus page, so we won't replicate details on them here.

## "What are some recommendations for running Gravewind?"

See above re: how to start it, and what to bring. This is definitely a mod you don't want to start unawares and unprepared.

This is also a mod that avoids relying on quest markers. So if you have trouble figuring out how to proceed through it, the mod's Nexus page does have a walkthrough behind spoiler tags.

And one more thing about the tar area mentioned above: waterwalking will _not_ save you from being killed by the tar.

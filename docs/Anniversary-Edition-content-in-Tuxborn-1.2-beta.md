‼️ **Information on this page is relevant only to the 1.2 beta version of Tuxborn. It will be subject to changes without warning as the testing on the beta proceeds, so please check back periodically for any new updates.** ‼️

This page is an overview of how content added to Skyrim by the Anniversary Edition, a.k.a. Creation Club, has been altered by Tuxborn's load order. We disable several of the Creations for various reasons, and many of the ones we're retaining have had significant changes. So here we provide a rundown on what changes you can expect with AE content in Tuxborn.

## General

Major changes to the AE as of Tuxborn 1.2 can be summarized as follows:

1. We have removed the quests related to the Alternative Armors (see next section).
2. CC Farming overhauls how you acquire Goldenhills Plantation (this was pertinent in previous builds, also pertinent in 1.2).
3. Several other AE quests have also been removed, to maintain compatibility with LOTD or other mods that have alternative ways to get the same artifacts. More details below.
4. We are dropping official support for Survival Mode. See below for more info on that.

## Alternative Armors

We have removed all of the quests involved with acquiring the various Alternative Armors. All armors in question _are_ still in the game, but they can now simply be acquired by creating them at any forge. Even if you don't intend to actually _use_ the armors, we recommend making at least one set of each, as they should be displayable in the LOTD museum. Relevant Smithing perks to make the items should still apply.

Certain additional items involved with the various armor quests have been adjusted so that you can still get them. This is important since these items are displayable in the LOTD museum as well. Here is a table of impacted items and the locations where you can get them:

| Item | Related Creation | How to acquire |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ring of Masser | Daedric Mail | Sold by Falion in Morthal |
| The Crimson Dirks, v5 | Daedric Mail | Sold by Falion in Morthal |
| The Crimson Dirks, v3 | Daedric Plate | Sold by Madenas in Dawnstar |
| The Crimson Dirks, v7 | Elven Hunter | Sold by Sybille in Solitude |
| The Crimson Dirks, v2 | Silver | Sold by Farengar in Whiterun |
| The Crimson Dirks, v6 | Orcish Scaled | Sold by Urag at the College of Winterhold |
| The Crimson Dirks, v4 | Studded Dragonscale | Sold by Urag at the College of Winterhold |
| The Crimson Dirks, v9 | Dwarven Plate | Sold by Urag at the College of Winterhold |
| The Crimson Dirks, v1 | Ebony Plate | Sold by Urag at the College of Winterhold |
| The Crimson Dirks, v8 | Dwarven Mail | Sold by Urag at the College of Winterhold |

## Bow of Shadows

The AE quest In the Shadows is impacted by Legacy of the Dragonborn.

You can still run the quest, but the bow you receive as a result will be the Bow of Obfuscation. Legacy of the Dragonborn has its own version of the Bow of Shadows, so its patches swap out the AE version for a renamed weapon. The renamed weapon still has the same enchantment as it does in the AE. The Bow of Shadows provided by LOTD has a different enchantment, and you get it at the tail end of running Shattered Legacy. You will need to decide which version of the bow you prefer. See [Quests in Legacy of the Dragonborn](Quests-in-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) for details.

Note that _both_ bows are displayable LOTD artifacts. So no matter which bow you prefer, you may wish to acquire both of them for museum purposes.

## The Cause

There are a couple of changes of note to this Creation:

1. When you are in the ruin of Rielle near Arcwind Point, there is an additional cave system connecting that part of the ruin to the Rielle accessible via Beyond Skyrim: Bruma. This unifies both versions of the ruin and turns it into one great big ruined city. And yes, this means Rielle is a backdoor way into Cyrodiil.
2. When you reach the Deadlands, the spell you can acquire to summon the Daedric Horse has been renamed to Conjure Nightmare Courser.

## Divine Crusader

This Creation is also impacted by Legacy of the Dragonborn. LOTD alters the acquisition of the armor pieces in this Creation, turning the quest into more of a scavenger hunt.

## Elite Crossbows

The Elite Crossbows creation is impacted by the mod Thwack! in our load order. See the Crossbows section of [Armor and weapons available in Tuxborn](Armor-and-weapons-available-in-Tuxborn/) for more information.

## Fishing

We are running the [Simple Fishing Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103440) mod, which makes assorted changes to fishing animations and adds in some dialogue lines for the Fishing-related quests. It also creates a requirement for you to use bait when fishing, although this can be turned off in the MCM.

Players interested in pursuing the Fishing quests should be aware that some of the fishing spots may be impacted by the mod we're using that adds ferry operators to the game, Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul. The fishing spot at the dock next to Honeyside's back stairs in Riften is an example of this, where the boat operator NPC is sitting right smack in the middle of the fishing supplies! The other three fishing spots in Riften may be problematic as well. So if you want to do the Fishing quest lines, we recommend avoiding Riften's fishing spots. All other fishing spots in the game should work as expected.

## Ghosts of the Tribunal

We are running [Ghosts of the Tribunal - Reduced Cut](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67019), but we're running the version that keeps the quest. So the main changes you should see with this Creation involve distributing several of its items out across the game, and renaming a couple of armor and weapon items.

Also, some of the artifacts normally available via this Creation are superseded by two mods: Legacy of the Dragonborn, and Moon and Star. Impacted artifacts include:

| Artifact | Change in our load order |
| --- | --- |
| Cleaver of St. Felms | Given by Auryen as a reward for 150 displays |
| Light of Day | Removed from the armory at Ashfall's Tear, and now given by Auryen as a reward for 400 displays |
| Magebane | Replaced in the Ashfall's Tear armory by Breathtaker, and acquired either as a reward in Moon and Star _or_ found in Ancestor Glade while running Dawnguard |
| Skull Crusher | Given by Auryen as a reward for 50 displays |

## Goldenhills Plantation

Goldenhills Plantation, the farm provided via the Farming Creation, is heavily impacted in our load order by the CC Farming mod. See [Goldenhills Plantation](Goldenhills-Plantation/) for details.

## The Gray Cowl Returns!

This Creation is disabled in our load order in favor of acquiring the Gray Cowl via the 10th Anniversary version of the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal mod.

## Lord's Mail

This artifact cuirass is normally obtainable via the AE quest Gift of Kynareth. In our load order, that quest is superseded by Legacy of the Dragonborn. The Lord's Mail is one of several artifacts important to running Shattered Legacy, so LOTD's quest takes precedence over the AE one.

Additionally, the mod Morihaus' Refuge _also_ has a version of the Lord's Mail. This is likely to result in a duplicate copy of the armor. We will have more information on this soon.

## Saints and Seducers Extended Cut changes

We include [Saints and Seducers Extended Cut](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772) in our load order, and this impacts multiple Creations as follows:

| Creation | Changes |
| --- | --- |
| Rare Curios | Ingredients available for purchase from Khajiit traders can also now be harvested in the Shivering Isles. |
| Ruin's Edge | This artifact weapon is now acquired in the Shivering Isles. |
| Saints and Seducers | The quest from this mod is completely removed, and most of its content is reworked by the Extended Cut mod. |
| Shadowrend | This artifact weapon is now acquired in the Shivering Isles. |
| Staff of Sheogorath | The quest Put a Fork In it, on Solstheim, is removed. The Fork of Horripilation and the Staff of Sheogorath are now acquired when you visit the Shivering Isles. |

See [Mod overview: Saints and Seducers Extended Cut](Mod-overview:-Saints-and-Seducers-Extended-Cut/) for more details.

## Stendarr's Hammer

In the vanilla AE, this weapon would be obtainable by stealing it from the Dwemer museum in Markarth. In our load order, you will receive it from Auryen as a reward for reaching 350 displays in your museum.

## Sunder & Wraithguard

This Creation's quest has been superseded by The Tools of Kagrenac mod in our load order. See [Mod overview: Tools of Kagrenac](Mod-overview:-Tools-of-Kagrenac/) for more details.

## Survival Mode

As of build 1.2, Survival Mode will no longer be officially supported in Tuxborn, although it is technically still present. Starfrost and Survival Mode Improved, the mods in previous builds that managed Survival Mode, have been removed for 1.2.

The reason for dropping support is that some strange bugs have come across Ouroboros' radar, and he legit doesn't have time to investigate and address them properly. So for now, we're going to drop official support.

If you're not comfortable with Rule 11'ing your install, and you want to play a survival mode run in Tuxborn, we recommend you do it in build 1.1.3.

You can still try to play a Survival Mode run in Tuxborn 1.2, but remember that you _will_ have to Rule 11 the load order to set up with your preferred Survival Mode mods. The toggle to turn on Survival Mode in the main game settings has been disabled, so you won't be able to activate it that way. You'll need to consider survival mods that don't rely upon that toggle being present.

Anna is conducting research into a possible R11 configuration involving SunHelm and Campsite, and will make information available on this once she's ready. She has a running thread on this on the #modlist-modifications channel, and will also put up a post on her blog to cover her findings. Survival Mode fans may wish to keep tabs on her research if you think you're going to want to do a survival run in 1.2.

We will not be taking down the [Survival mode](Survival-mode/) page yet as that information is still relevant to build 1.1.3, our current official build, as well as any earlier Tuxborn build. That page has however been tweaked to make it clear it will not apply to 1.2.

‼️ **And as a general reminder, whether you decide to implement the same R11 config Anna does or build one of your own, disabling fast travel will break the Dev Aveza in Legacy of the Dragonborn! So if you care about the airship continuing to work, DO NOT TURN OFF FAST TRAVEL.** ‼️

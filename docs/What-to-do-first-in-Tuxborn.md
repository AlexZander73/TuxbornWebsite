Once you come out of chargen, you may be asking yourself, "What do I do now?"

You have options! This page is to go over what some of those options are.

## Main quest

If you don't specifically _want_ to delay running Skyrim's main quest, we recommend starting that. See the [Main quest](Main-quest/) page for details.

## Launch Legacy of the Dragonborn

If you're interested in running Legacy of the Dragonborn, we recommend launching that early. Doing so will give you three immediate fetch quests to run for Auryen, the museum curator. And it will also get you reasonably quick access to the Safehouse, the primary player home offered by LOTD, once you have 50 displays in your museum. (You get it immediately if you do the Relic Hunter start!) See the [Frequently Asked Questions: Legacy of the Dragonborn](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) page for more details.

## Find some favor quests or bounties

Wherever you land on the map coming out of chargen, consider going to the nearest city and looking for NPCs to give you fetch quests or bounties. This can give you some immediate things to do to start building up your gold, so you can pay for gear.

Some ways you can do this, including both vanilla and Tuxborn-specific ones:

* Talk to the nearest city steward or innkeeper to ask about looking for work.
* Shopkeepers will also have a dialogue option on them for you to ask if they need help with anything, this can be another way to get bounties on bandits.
* Depending on which innkeeper you talk to, they may have multiple ways of asking them about rumors around town. These are generally hooks into content for Interesting NPCs, or for finding certain followers.

## Talk to unfamiliar NPCs

If you're only familiar with vanilla Skyrim, then there will be a _lot_ of NPCs wandering around that you won't recognize. A bunch of them are added to the game just by Interesting NPCs, all by itself. If you see an unfamiliar NPC go by, talk to them! You may get just a conversation out of them. But you may also get a quest! Chat with anybody you don't recognize, and find out which.

## Find some followers

If you like the idea of having a follower squad, one of the first things you might want to do is go find the followers you're interested in. See [Followers available in Tuxborn](Followers-available-in-Tuxborn/) for details, and overviews on all the major custom followers we're running.

## Join a faction

You can always start in on any Skyrim faction you're interested in joining. Most of the standard Skyrim factions still have the same methods as vanilla for joining, with a couple of exceptions:

* If you want to join the College of Winterhold, there will be some initial extra quests you'll need to do between when you talk to Faralda on the bridge, and when Tolfdir will take you to Saarthal.
* If you want to join the Thieves Guild, you will need to do some preliminary crime before Brynjolf will talk to you in Riften, so plan for that.

Further details on both of these can be found on the [How to start various quests in Tuxborn](How-to-start-various-quests-in-Tuxborn/) page.

## Get a horse

You don't absolutely _need_ a horse, but it's worth considering. See the [Frequently Asked Questions: Horses and other mounts](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-Horses-and-other-mounts/) page for details.

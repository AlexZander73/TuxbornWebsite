This page is a roundup of additional resources that may be useful to Tuxborn's players!

## The Tuxborn Companion spreadsheet and web page

User Kok0 has kindly created a very thorough spreadsheet players can use to track their progress through Tuxborn's quest content. Here's what this spreadsheet is about in Kok0's own words:

> This is a spreadsheet of almost all content mods in Tuxborn; I'm still making sure no mod that adds quests of sorts is left out. Everything you need to do is to make a copy and use it as a checklist for the mods you have completed and displays filled; I've implemented a couple of filters to help find the mod you're most interested and each mod comes with enough info on how to get it started and main functionalities it adds

> For example, regarding the player homes, you can use the Tag filter to search for mods I've tagged as such

> The version is lower because there are still a couple of mods that need to be added (like Demon slayer, crimson trial and some other misc minor quests) so I kept it below 1.0

> But the list is already complete with all the mods that have displays in the museum and are included in the New Content of the modlist

Kok0's spreadsheet is available via Google Docs [at this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HzoB06GWpWGvLCa3qLuvxmsM4Q5IZp-GYvYIKLLCM1A/edit?usp=sharing).

Additionally, there is now an [initial draft of a web page](https://kahootics.github.io/Tuxborn_Companion/) version of this guide. So keep an eye on that as well!

## Player-recommended mods

Certain use cases for Tuxborn are ones that the dev team cannot directly support, because we do not have appropriate hardware to do so. Nonetheless, players who find solutions to solve problems in these cases periodically report mods that are helpful. We will list such mods here.

Again, the Tuxborn dev team _cannot support using these mods_, so please take discussion of them to #modlist-modifications. Thank you!

| Mod name | Use case |
| --- | --- |
| [Complete Controller Setup](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99978) | Players on handhelds other than Steam Decks may wish to consider this mod for refinement of your controller layout. ROG Ally players on the Discord have been looking into this one. |
| [Complete Widescreen Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1778) | This mod has been reported as useful for players with ultra-wide monitors. See [Tuxborn in ultra‐wide](Tuxborn-in-ultra‐wide/) for a bit more info. |

## Player-recommended preset packs

The following is a list of preset packs confirmed by Tuxborn players as working out of the box with the modpack. Pick and choose from these at your discretion. Tuxborn may or may not have all mods necessary in its load order to achieve the same results portrayed by the screenshots on these pages, but if it's linked here, you can assume it'll deliver at least playable results.

* [Duneborne](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92750) - An assortment of male Redguard presets
* [Duncan De la Fonte](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19946) - A Breton male preset

## Guides from Annathepiper

Anna has some guides on her blog that are of interest to Tuxborn players. Since these are guides written by Anna, please ask her about this info if you have questions:

* [HOWTO: Set up a radial menu on a Steam Deck game](https://skyrim.annathepiper.org/2025/03/25/howto-set-up-a-radial-menu-on-a-steam-deck-game/): Steam Deck players might want to learn how to set up a radial menu, as having one available can greatly improve the Tuxborn play experience. Steam Deck players are the primary intended audience for this guide, but the process should also work for PC players who use controllers, if your controller has a trackpad on it or configurable buttons.
* [HOWTO: Sync Skyrim saves between devices](https://skyrim.annathepiper.org/2025/03/14/howto-sync-skyrim-saves-between-devices/): Players interested in playing the same Tuxborn save across multiple devices should have a look at this guide for suggestions on how to set that up.
* [HOWTO: Use Syncthing to sync between devices](https://skyrim.annathepiper.org/2025/05/21/howto-use-syncthing-to-sync-between-devices/): This is a guide to using Syncthing to sync your saves across devices, if you want to use this tool in particular to sync your Tuxborn saves.

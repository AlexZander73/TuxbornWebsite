## What's in the load order for Tuxborn 1.1.3

Our pages on Load Order Library is now up to date for version 1.1.3 of the modpack. We have two: [this one](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/tuxborn) for the standard Tuxborn load order, and [this one](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/tuxborn-bfco) for the BFCO load order.

Additionally, our [Changelog](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Tuxborn/blob/main/Changelog.md) provides a running history of how the load order has changed across Tuxborn's various updates.

We also have a [search link](https://www.wabbajack.org/search/Tuxborn/Tuxborn) available on wabbajack.org.

## Anniversary Edition content changes
<details>
<summary><i>Frequently Asked Questions about Anniversary Edition content...</i></summary>
<h3>"What mods are you running that change the Anniversary Edition/Creation Club content?"</h3>

<p>We're running a few mods that have a lot of impact on various parts of the Anniversary Edition. The most significant one of these is Rebalancing Anniversary Edition, which changes the level requirements for a <i>lot</i> of the AE content, and in a couple of cases adds other requirements as well. Anything that the RAE mod impacts can generally be adjusted in its MCM, on the Mod Configuration menu in your game. The overall goal of this mod is to do exactly what it says on the tin: add a bit of balance to the AE content, and spread it out some so that you don't front-load your playthrough with a lot of high-level stuff.</p>

<p>In short, if something you're familiar with in Anniversary Edition content isn't behaving the way you expect it to, the RAE mod is probably responsible. There <i>are</i> exceptions to this, though, as noted below.<p>

<h3>"But I <i>want</i> the high level stuff!"</h3>

<p>We hear you. It <i>is</i> shiny stuff. If you want to revert any part of RAE's changes back to original AE requirements, review its MCM and adjust settings accordingly.</p>

### "Why can't I run the plot to get Hendraheim yet? I wanted that for one of my first houses!"

Hendraheim's plot launch is delayed in our load order to level 25, due to RAE.

### "Why can't I get into Myrwatch? I have the Flames spell!"

RAE changes the access to Myrwatch. In addition to having the Flames spell, the seal on the entrance also now checks how much Magicka you have. It won't let you in unless your Magicka is at least 350.

### "Why is the family at Goldenhills Plantation still alive?"

We're running the CC Farming mod which significantly changes the plot surrounding Goldenhills Plantation. See the [Vanilla player homes available in Tuxborn](Vanilla-player-homes-available-in-Tuxborn/) page and the [How to start various quests in Tuxborn](How-to-start-various-quests-in-Tuxborn/) page for additional details.

### "I wanted to run the In the Shadows plot, but Proventus doesn't have a prompt for it!"

RAE makes two changes to this: it wants you to finish the Thieves Guild plotline first, _and_ it sets a level requirement. Either or both of these can be adjusted in the MCM.

### "I ran In the Shadows, but got a Bow of Obfuscation instead...?"

This is because of Legacy of the Dragonborn's patches. Legacy has its own version of the Bow of Shadows, so it swapped out the one given at the end of the AE plot for a renamed artifact. The Bow of Obfuscation will still function as per the AE version of the Bow of Shadows. But if you want the artifact actually named Bow of Shadows, you'll need to run LOTD and get fairly far into its plotline in order to get that version of the bow. Note also that LOTD's version of the Bow of Shadows does behave slightly differently than the AE bow, so even if you have both of them, they are not identical. Also, both should be displayable in the museum.

### "Why can't I find the Studded Dragonscale Armor at Yorgrim Overlook? I launched the plot!"

RAE makes it so that you have to be at least level 50, _and_ have Dragon smithing unlocked, in order for the armor to actually spawn.

### "I wanted to run the Sunder & Wraithguard quest, but can't find it."

That quest is disabled in our load order by Legacy of the Dragonborn patches, and because we have the Tools of Kagrenac mod in our load order as well. So if you want Sunder and Wraithguard, you'll need to run the Tools of Kagrenac mod.

More information on this can be found on the [Mod overview: Tools of Kagrenac](Mod-overview:-Tools-of-Kagrenac/) page.

### "I ran The Gray Cowl Returns, but didn't get the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal at the end, what happened?"

We have the 10th anniversary edition of the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal mod, and patches that make that version of the Gray Cowl take precedence over the one that appears at the end of the AE plot. Run the mod plot to get the Gray Cowl.

## Tuxborn content changes between 0.5.2 and 1.1.3

Tuxborn's current version is 1.1.3. If you last played Tuxborn on version 0.5.2, here's an overview of the content changes between the two versions.

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of changes between the two major public versions of Tuxborn...</i></summary>
<h3>Restructuring of the available setup profiles</h3>

Tuxborn 1.1.3 has a different arrangement of profiles available for players to choose from. There are still two major groups, one for the BFCO combat system and the other that uses Blade and Blunt. However, inside each of those groups, the previous CS profiles have been removed. Instead of a separate CS profile, the two groups now include a Desktop, a Handheld, and a Deck profile.

All profiles have Community Shaders.

See the [Save‐safe](Save‐safe/) page for further information on which of these profiles are save compatible with each other.

<h3>Performance improvements in Legacy of the Dragonborn museum for Steam Deck players</h3>

Solving this issue was the big motivator for rearranging the profiles in MO2. Steam Deck playes should explicitly use the Deck profiles, as those have a somewhat reduced load order to improve performance on that device, particularly when visiting the museum in Legacy of the Dragonborn. Players that use other handheld devices such as the ROG Ally can use the Handheld profile, which has the same mod set as Desktop.

Steam Deck players should not try to run the Handheld profile unless they are specifically wanting to use the same save file on a Tuxborn setup on a computer. If you <i>do</i> plan to do that, we recommend that you save all museum activity for your computer. Anything outside of the LOTD museum, and probably also out of Solitude in general, should be safe to play on the Deck even with the Handheld profile. But prior museum/Solitude performance issues will probably still happen on the Deck with the Handheld profile.

<h3>New quest content</h3>

The following new quest mods were added:

* Sleepwalking Into a Nightmare
* Final Farewell
* The Thrassian Scare
* 10th Anniversary edition of The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal

### Changes in followers

The following new followers were added:

* Katana, and her associated NPCs who can also follow you, Megara and Shale
* Melana
* Jesper the Whiterun guard

These followers were removed due to their mods being removed from Nexus:

* Eris
* Nessa

### Update of mod versions

All previously existing mods that were in 0.5.2 and have carried over to 1.1.3 should be updated to most recent versions.

### Changes in mods that alter Skyrim mechanics

* Honed Metal was removed
* Deadly Dragon was replaced by Dragon War for version 1.0
* Dragon War was dropped for version 1.1, since it was causing crashes
* Nether's Follower Framework was swapped out for Underwhelming Multiple Followers (UMF)
* Vokrii was replaced by Adamant
* Skyrim is Luminous was dropped
* Amethyst, Amethyst Plus, and KreatE were replaced by Azurite Weather and Seasons

### Removal of Alternate Start: Live Another Life Voice Pack

Since the ASLAL voice pack vanished off of Nexus, Tuxborn had to account for its absence in the release of a new test build. Alternate Start itself is still in place, it's just the additional voice pack that was missing.

The voice pack was adding voiced lines in two different situations:

1. If you talk to an innkeeper to get the pointer to go to Helgen to check out the Imperial activity there
2. If, after arriving in Helgen and seeing Alduin torch the place, you decide to go find Hadvar or Ralof in the cave

Without the voice pack, the NPC dialogue is silent, so you won't be able to see what the characters say unless you have subtitles turned on.

However, neither of these scenarios is actually critical, you can skip both of them and avoid the problem entirely. If you're playing Legacy of the Dragonborn and you do the Relic Hunter start, the initial fetch quest to bring Auryen some relics will give you an excuse to go to Helgen anyway. And, you also have the option of just going straight to Riverwood to warn them about the dragon attack, you don't actually have to go find Hadvar or Ralof.

(If you're playing LOTD and you do NOT do the Relic Hunter start, you'll still need to head to Helgen on your own to trigger Alduin's attack. Whether you bother to talk to an innkeeper to get the prompt about this is up to you.)

So basically you either a) need to have subtitles on, at least long enough to get through the bits without voiced lines, or b) just skip those bits. Do whichever you prefer.

### Wintersun replaced by Pilgrim

Tuxborn 0.5.2 and the first of the two public 1.0 test builds had Wintersun. However, we swapped to Pilgrim for the 1.0 release, and Pilgrim has been maintained up to 1.1.3. So we're swapping from Enarim's religions mod over to Simonrim's, instead.

The first main difference between Wintersun and Pilgrim is that Pilgrim doesn't require you to regularly pray in order to maintain favor with your god. Nor do you have to commit to following a specific god. Instead, blessings from shrines are powered by the Pilgrim perk in Restoration, or the Cultist perk in Conjuration. Choose wisely. Prayer _does_ still exist, but instead of bumping favor with a specific god, it refreshes the blessing you got from the last shrine you prayed at.

And a second, very important difference is, Pilgrim removes the ability of shrines to cure diseases! You _must_ seek out or make Potions of Cure Disease to handle your disease curing needs. The mod does, however, add additional priest vendors in the five major cities, to sell such items and other things useful for healing and restoration.

Anyone playing LOTD in this load order, take note that the switch to Pilgrim means we lose the displays added by Wintersun to the museum. There is apparently an equivalent patch for Pilgrim, but that's not currently in the Tuxborn load order. 

### QuickLoot

1.1.3's load order includes a mod called QuickLoot, which lets you, as you might expect from the name, loot stuff more quickly. This includes chests and other containers, as well as corpses. If you roll your crosshair over something lootable, you should see a little popup appear showing you all the various things you can loot. Note that if a chest is locked, you won't see this popup until you unlock the chest.

Steam Deck players or PC players who use a controller, you can use your DPad buttons to navigate up and down the list in the popup if you don't want to just take everything.

QuickLoot has been mostly stable in the test build, but I've reported one instance of it causing a crash when trying to loot a chest I'd tried to unlock in the worldspace for Carved Brink. So anyone running the test build is advised to be on the lookout for any similar issues, and report them to the support channel if you see them.

### Shades of Mortality

We added an optional death mechanics mod to the Tuxborn load order, called Shades of Mortality. Since this is a significant change to how death works for the player, Shades of Mortality gets an entire page of its own. Refer to the [Frequently Asked Questions: Shades of Mortality](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-Shades-of-Mortality/) page for more info.

### Hotfix for 1.0.1

Shortly after 1.0 was officially released, we had to put out a hotfix to fix a crash in the BFCO profiles that could reproduce when the player was fighting Falmer.

### Changes for 1.1

This was a bugfix release, addressing several issues reported during play on 1.0 and 1.0.1. The main changes for this release were the removal of Dragon War, and the removal of all mods related to Achievement Injector. The Legacy of the Dragonborn Achievements mod for Achievement Injector was causing issues with save load times.

### Hotfix for 1.1.1

This corrected a version mismatch for Resurrection API, used by Shades of Mortality.

## General questions on mods
<details>
<summary><i>Frequently Asked Questions about mods...</i></summary>
<h3>"I don't see my favorite mod that does (fill in the blank) in your load order. Can I add it?"</h3>

Please be aware that if you make any of your own changes to the modpack, our devs' policy is that this will void your access to official support from them if you run into any trouble. Players who wish to make any of their own changes to the Tuxborn modpack are therefore asked to direct any questions about that to the #modlist-modifications channel on our Discord.

If you're okay with this, then sure, add whatever you like. This is not recommended, however, for players new to modding in general, or new to using Wabbajack and Mod Organizer 2 in particular.

See Ouroboros' page [Modding Tuxborn and You](Modding-Tuxborn-and-You/) for additional points you should review.

### "What quest mods do you have in your load order?"

Quite a few. Legacy of the Dragonborn is our centerpiece, but we include several other quest mods both large and small. 

Check the Load Order Library links given further up the page for the quest mods we have.

### "I don't like the Clockwork mod in your load order. Do I have to play it?"

This mod auto-starts, and there's no way around that. You'll be attacked out of the blue by an NPC named Isidor at level 5. He'll have a note on him from another NPC named Camilla (not the one in Riverwood, an NPC unique to this mod).

You'll get an objective to read that note. If you do, you'll get the objective to go find the ruins that will lead you to the Clockwork worldspace.

But if you don't want to play the mod, you should either just not read the note, or disregard the objective to go find the ruins if you forget and read the note anyway. Unfortunately we do not have a way for you to cancel or hide either of those objectives once you have them, sorry.

### "I'm not a fan of some other mod in your load order. Do I have to play it?"

Some of our mods will not start automatically, and therefore they are easy to avoid if you don't want to run them. Mods known to be in this category are:

* Carved Brink
* Falskaar
* Project AHO
* The Wheel of Time

Others do have automatic starts (such as Clockwork, noted above). As with Clockwork, we do not have a way for you to avoid those starts. Our best recommendation for you at this time is to not play past the automatic start point. In some cases, this will simply mean ignoring a courier or other messenger that comes looking for you. In others, it may mean you'll have to play through an initial scene or confrontation.

Either way this will, unfortunately, mean you'd have a permanently unfinished objective in your journal, and we do not have a way for you to hide or remove an unfinished objective at this time.

Mods known to be in this category are:

* Beyond Reach
* Clockwork
* Glenmoril
* Legacy of the Dragonborn
* Meridia's Order
* Midwood Isle
* Moon and Star
* Vigilant
* Warden of the Coast
* Wheels of Lull
* Wyrmstooth

## Armor and weapons

<summary><i>Frequently Asked Questions on armor and weapons...</i></summary>

<h3>"What custom armor and weapons are available in Tuxborn?"</h3>

Have a look at the [Armor and weapons available in Tuxborn](Armor-and-weapons-available-in-Tuxborn/) page.

### "Is there a way to hide my helmet in Tuxborn?"

Not at this time.

### "Is there any way for me to get Katana's rifle to use as my own weapon?"

No, unfortunately. The author of Katana's mod calls this out explicitly on the [FAQ article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5553) for the [mod page on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69622). 

### "Are there any other types of gun available in Tuxborn?"

There are two known ways to get gun-like weaponry in our load order:

1. Run Wheels of Lull
2. Run Glenmoril

Wheels of Lull includes a weapon called a harqebus in its content. This weapon is rifle-like, and comes in six different forms, all of which are displayable in the LOTD museum. More information about these weapons can be found on the [[Frequently Asked Questions: Wheels of Lull]] page.

Glenmoril's weapons are available only once you level up enough that you could run the mod, at which point the vendor that sells Glenmoril items will spawn at the Roadside Ruins. You do _not_ have to launch Glenmoril to get access to him, and by extension, to use Glenmoril's guns if you want them. The ammo for its weapons should be the various types of shot you can see as options to craft at any forge. Look at [[Frequently Asked Questions: Glenmoril]] for further info.

### "Auri's mod page says the marker for her pod should be on my map, but I don't see it. How can I find her pod?"

Our load order means that the marker for her pod will not be auto-discovered. For pointers as to how to find her, look at the Auri section of the Followers link given above.

Community Shaders has a complex UI that can't be easily handled via an MCM or an INI file. This page discusses how players on handheld devices can get at the CS UI.

Handheld players will want to note two things:

1. The proper hotkey expected to launch Community Shaders, so you can bind that hotkey to a button or radial menu on your handheld
2. How to use your handheld's functionality to bring up a mouse pointer, and how to emulate mouse clicks

## "What keybind will bring up the UI for Community Shaders?"

By default, it is set to the End key. 

If for some reason you'd like to set it to some other key, you can do so in the CS UI in the General > Keybindings settings.

## "How can I use the UI for Community Shaders on a Steam Deck?"

Steam Deck players have one of two options here:

1. Bind the End key to any available back button
2. Set up a radial menu, and assign the End key to options on that menu

When you are setting up a keybind, either for one of your back buttons _or_ for a radial menu, note that in the UI for doing so, you will need to go to the Numpad section to get to the End key. It does not appear in the main Keyboard section.

Anna has a guide to how to create a radial menu on a Steam Deck on the [Additional player resources](Additional-player-resources/) page.

Once the UI for Community Shaders is loaded, then you can use the Steam Deck's built-in functionality to activate a mouse pointer:

1. Hold down the STEAM button on the left side of your device
2. Roll your thumb over your right trackpad to spawn a pointer
3. Use your right trigger for mouse clicks

This will let you work with the UI as you need to.

## "How can I use the UI for Community Shaders on other handhelds?"

Players on other handheld types besides Steam Deck will basically need to follow the same ideas described above: how to map controls on your device, and how to handle mouse functionality.

Any handheld that uses SteamOS, or otherwise has access to Steam via Windows or Linux, should be able to use the same UI as Steam Deck players to map keybinds for buttons.

ROG Ally players should doublecheck your device's capabilities on the [ROG Ally FAQ](https://rog.asus.com/us/support/faq/1050046/) page.

## "Can I use a Bluetooth keyboard for Community Shaders on my handheld?"

If you happen to have a Bluetooth keyboard available, absolutely. Just be sure to doublecheck your keyboard in case it does not have a physical End key. It may require you to do a key combo to simulate that, such as Fn + Right Arrow.

This page is an overview of player homes available in Legacy of the Dragonborn. For general information on LOTD, please look at the [Frequently Asked Questions: Legacy of the Dragonborn](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) page.

Legacy of the Dragonborn has several options available as player homes: two actual homes, one airship, three outposts, and one very fancy tent that can serve as a miniature player home when you're traveling.

## The Safehouse

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of the Safehouse...</i></summary>
<br>

<p>The Safehouse is by far the most important of the player homes available in LOTD. It's the player home space built into the Dragonborn Gallery, the main museum building added by the mod. It has a large variety of crafting stations, not only vanilla ones but additional custom ones as well. It has a very thorough storage system for many types of items, a storage system you can access from the Dev Aveza, from Rains' Shelter, from Explorer's Society outposts, and from the Stash Supplies spell. And it has a Sell Cart you can use to sell off excess loot that you don't want to have to personally haul to a merchant. It's also very customizable! In short, it's extremely worth getting.</p>

To make use of the Sell Cart, you need to have a minimum of 100 displays in your museum. This will activate a dialogue option with Auryen where you can tell him you have too much stuff. Take this option, and he will offer to arrange to sell unneeded items for you. At that point, you can place anything you don't want in the Sell Cart. Every in-game day, the cart will sell off a portion of what it contains. The gold from those sales will go into the strongbox on the shelves just around the corner.

Using the Sell Cart won't make as much money as selling directly to merchants. But it's an excellent way to get rid of unwanted loot/clutter!

See [the page for the Safehouse](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/The_Safehouse_(SSE)) on the Legacy of the Dragonborn wiki for more information.

How you get the Safehouse will depend on how you choose to start your playthrough.

### Getting the Safehouse via Relic Hunter Alternate Start

If you want the Safehouse right out of the gate, then you should choose the Relic Hunter Alternate Start when you make your character. To do this, choose the option on the Mara statue that has you coming to Skyrim on a ship, and choose Solitude as your destination. Once you arrive on the Solitude docks, you will get an additional prompt asking you if you're coming to Solitude as the museum's relic hunter. Tell it yes, then proceed to the Dragonborn Gallery to meet Auryen. At that point, he'll give you the key to the Safehouse.

### Getting the Safehouse via any other Alternate Start option

If you take any other path through Alternate Start to set up your character, but you still plan to play Legacy of the Dragonborn, Auryen will give you access to the Safehouse as soon as you have 50 displays in the museum. He will do this by sending you a courier with a letter and a key, who will find you in the first city you enter after hitting the 50 display mark. (Note: if you're in Solitude when you reach 50 displays, the courier may not show. If he doesn't, go to any other city instead.)

So if you go this route, you may wish to purchase Breezehome first or the land to start building Lakeview, just so you can have a starter home while you work on the museum.

### Which followers you can have stay at the Safehouse

Unfortunately, the Safehouse does not come with the functionality to let you have followers live there along with you. Some of the receipts you can buy to customize it _do_ have follower-themed furniture, but that is _not_ the same thing. (See the [Follower's Room A](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Follower%27s_Room_A) and [Follower's Room B](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Follower%27s_Room_B) pages on the LOTD wiki for more information about this.) As the LOTD wiki points out, you would need a follower framework like Nether's, or a mod like My Home is Your Home, to permit followers in general to live there.

That said, some of Tuxborn's custom followers _do_ have their own functionality to let them live in places you specify. Here's what we know about how various followers handle this:

| Follower | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Katana | Can be invited to stay |
| Lucien | Does not have code to allow him to live there, but if you ask him to wait there, he'll do so indefinitely and will also sandbox around the place, so that's almost as good |
| Megara | Can be invited to stay, as she uses the same framework as Katana |
| Remiel | Can be invited to stay, and even has lines about it |
| Shale | Can be invited to stay, as he uses the same framework as Katana |
| Xelzaz | Can be invited to stay |

### Settling a family at the Safehouse

Similarly to followers, the Safehouse does not automatically let you settle a family there. As per [the LOTD wiki page for the Safehouse](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/The_Safehouse_(SSE)), if you want to do this, you need the Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions mod, and its "Bless Home" ability. And we do not have that mod in our load order.

We recommend picking up Proudspire Manor to be a supplementary home base, and using that as the place for your family to settle.

## The Dev Aveza

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of the Dev Aveza...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>This is the airship you acquire as part of the Legacy of the Dragonborn plotline, and it's likely to be where you spend a lot of your time as you travel the land throughout your playthrough. While it doesn't have all the same custom craft stations the Safehouse does, it does have its own versions of all the vanilla crafting stations.</p>

There's only one safe storage chest, but given that the airship hooks into the Safehouse's on-site storage, this isn't really an issue.

There is no way to house a family on board the airship, or for that matter, to assign followers to live there with you even though there are several hammocks belowdecks. Followers that have custom AI may follow you belowdecks and sandbox, or even sleep in the player bed, but that will depend on which followers you choose to use.

So the Dev Aveza might serve as a complement to an on-ground home base, if a house you like doesn't include all the crafting stations you want, but is otherwise good for you.

The airship can go anywhere on the map you've already discovered, and for which there is a fast travel marker. This includes alternate worldspaces, such as Wyrmstooth, Solstheim, and Midwood. For Solstheim in particular, if you can arrange to go there prior to launching Dragonborn, do so! Because then, you'll be able to use the Dev Aveza to return to Solstheim later, and that will give you a very handy way to store loot and craft supplies until you run the plot to get Severin Manor.

### ‼️ Cautionary notes about the Dev Aveza ‼️

There are two important things you'll want to keep in mind about the airship.

One: The Dev Aveza requires fast travel to be active in order to work. If you are playing Survival Mode, be sure to leave fast travel active even though you can turn it off in the INI file for Starfrost. More info about this is available on the [Survival mode](Survival-mode/) page.

And two: while the Dev Aveza can take you anywhere you have a discovered fast travel marker for, in actual practice, you may find some locations problematic. The airship will frequently situate itself in such a way as to make its boarding ladder hard to find, or in some cases, outright unreachable. If this happens to you, you may find yourself having to fast travel straight back onto the airship.

Some known areas where this kind of issue shows up include but are not limited to:

* Lakeview Manor, where the boarding ladder comes down in the middle of the tree right next to the front door
* Meridia's Sanctum and Fort Justice, locations added by the Meridia's Order mod
* The Whiterun Stables, where the airship will render up high enough that you can't actually reach the ladder
* The access point down into Lull-Mor, at the very southern edge of the map

This kind of issue seems more common for locations that have been changed by other mods, which LOTD may not have accounted for when setting up how the airship renders when you arrive somewhere. So you may need to do some strategic planning as to where you travel via the airship. 

### Requirements for getting the Dev Aveza

To get the Dev Aveza, you need to pick up a quest from Auryen to go get the Staff of Indarys. The NPC who has it, Rakis, is in the worldspace for Moonpath to Elsweyr. So you have to go run the entire Moonpath to Elsweyr plot in order to reach him. See [Mod overview: Moonpath to Elsweyr](Mod-overview:-Moonpath-to-Elsweyr/) for further details on this.

Once you return from running Moonpath, then a few in-game days after, you will be gifted the Dev Aveza by the Khajiit that you helped out down in Elsweyr.

The LOTD wiki seems to indicate that the Dev Aveza is the same airship you receive as part of the Moonpath to Elsweyr questline ([source](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Tenmar_Forest_Hideout)), as far as its canon is concerned. However, if that's the case, there's a discrepancy of names for the ship between Moonpath and LOTD, so you may wish to just headcanon that your Khajiit contacts rename it for you when they deliver it to you in Solitude.

### How to dock the Dev Aveza

If you use the Dev Aveza to return to Solitude and just travel to the markers for Solitude or the Dragonborn Gallery on your airship map, this will not make the airship dock itself behind your guildhall. There are two different known ways to put your airship back at the dock for it:

1. There should be a fast travel marker specifically for the Explorers Society guildhouse dock. This may be hard to spot on your map, if it overlaps with the marker for the Dragonborn Gallery. You may need to zoom your map in closer to spot it, or, carefully arrange where your pointer is to make the proper marker appear. Using that specific marker should dock the airship at the guildhall.
2. On board the airship, go belowdecks, to the console that shows the maps, in the bow of the ship. Look immediately to the left of the maps, and there should be an activator there to tell the ship to return to the museum and dock.
3. Use a debug method (see next session) to reset the airship.

### What to do if the Dev Aveza gets stuck

There are two mechanisms provided by LOTD to do a reset of the airship if required:

1. Look on the mantel over the fireplace in the Safehouse's living room, immediately to the left of the plaque for Avram's sword. You should see a ship-in-a-bottle model, and if you roll your pointer over that, it'll give you an activator labeled "Reset Airship". Activating this will prompt you about whether you want to bring the airship back to dock at the Explorers Society Dock.
2. On the MCM for LOTD Debug, there is a command for resetting the airship which will basically do the same thing.

Additionally, it is sometimes possible to put the airship into a stuck state if you activate the navigation wheel, but then change your mind. This can make the ship think it's still about to go somewhere. To clear that state, just activate the navigation wheel again, and look for a notification in the upper right corner of your screen that your previous trip has been cancelled.

### Smuggler's hold on the Dev Aveza

There is a secret compartment on board the airship, hidden under a rug on the lower floor, in between the weapons racks and the storage area for miscellaneous items and armor. Activate that rug, and it will reveal the hatch to the compartment. Inside the compartment, you'll find two chests and one of Sanamia's journals. The journal is displayable, and launches an excavation mini-quest you can run for loot.

The chests are an excellent place to stash any stolen loot you may happen to have.

## Karagas' Tower

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of Karagas' Tower...</i></summary>
<br>

<a href="https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Ruins_of_Rkund_-_Karagas%27_Tower">Karagas' Tower</a> is a subset of the Ruins of Rkund. This is a vanilla location greatly expanded by Legacy of the Dragonborn, and one of the major LOTD questlines involves you doing an excavation there with your guild.

You need to run the entire Rkund excavation to get access to the tower. But once you do, you can use it as a player home. You'll acquire a staff to use that will give you instant porting back to the tower if you wish, and you'll also be able to come back on the Dev Aveza.

Note that the tower, unlike the Dev Aveza, does not hook into Safehouse storage. So if access to the storage is important to you, that may be a dealbreaker for using the tower as your home base all by itself. If that is not a dealbreaker for you, and if you also are a fan of Dwemer ruins and don't mind its location, you might consider it.
</details>

## The Explorer's Society outposts

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of the Explorer's Society outposts...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>Through the course of the LOTD plotline, if you trigger the correct circumstances, you can receive side quests to build outposts for your Explorer's Society. These are intended to serve as waystations where members of your guild can restock when they're in the field.</p>

The three outposts are all structured the same way, and include a couple of beds as well as all critical crafting stations. Additionally, each one should come with a merchant NPC who will have access to the same inventory carried by Eriana in the main guildhouse. Since they are all very basic, you wouldn't want to use them as primary home bases. But they are excellent places to stop, sleep, and restock if you need to.

Requirements to build these outposts are:

* You need to have fully launched your guild, so that you have Marassi available to give you the outpost quests.
* To build the outpost near Saarthal, you have to complete The Eye of Magnus in the College of Winterhold questline.
* To build the outpost near Rorikstead, at least a week of game time has to pass after the first outpost is built, and you must also complete No One Escapes From Cidhna Mine.
* To build the outpost near Fort Amol, you should have a similar short delay since building the second outpost, and you must also complete the acquisition of the Gauldur Amulet.

## Rains' Shelter

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of Rains' Shelter...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>This is a player home only in the very loosest sense of the term, because it's not actually a house, it's a tent. But it's a tent that comes very well equipped--and it does hook into Safehouse storage.</p>

You can acquire this tent as part of running the Legacy of the Dragonborn quest Tools of the Trade. (See [Quests in Legacy of the Dragonborn](Quests-in-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) for more on this quest.) Acquiring the shelter ASAP is highly recommended, as the Tuxborn load order does not include a camping mod, and Rains' Shelter is definitely superior to the Camping functionality included in the AE. Since Rains' Shelter is its own tiny worldspace you port into when you use the Shelter from your inventory, you can use it anywhere. Including places you can't put AE campsites!

### ‼️ Cautionary notes about Rains' Shelter ‼️

Rains' Shelter exists in the world even prior to you signing on with the museum, so if you know where to look, it's possible to pick it up and use it even before you begin Legacy of the Dragonborn. However, for RP purposes, this is counter to the intention of the Tools of the Trade quest, a scavenger hunt to find various useful items that are all dedicated to contributors to Legacy of the Dragonborn. So players should decide for themselves if it's more important to get the shelter ASAP, or to preserve the RP of the scavenger hunt. With that in mind, we will not document its location here, in the name of preserving a bit of a sense of surprise and exploration, and to avoid spoilers. We will, however, note that if you don't know where to look, Kamahl's Map will give you quest markers.

And if you really want to look up where the item is, you can do so on [Rains' Shelter page](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Rains'_Shelter) on the LOTD wiki.

Also, similarly to turning on the Stash Supplies spell in the LOTD settings, Rains' Shelter gives you access to the Safehouse storage even if you don't have the Safehouse yet. Players should be cautious in taking advantage of this. Any weapons, armor, jewelry, or clothing you stash this way will not be available to you until you actually acquire the Safehouse. So if you have an item in any of these categories that you wish to sell, temper, or enchant so that you can use it, do not stash it until you do so.

## "What changes does Tuxborn make to Dawnguard?"

The overall plot is still fundamentally the same. However, there are still some notable changes.

### Serana

We are running [Anima Nera](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57698), a visual overhaul for Serana, by the same modder who did the visual overhaul we're using for Lydia. 

You will also see Serana casting some of the custom spells included in our load order, such as Cold Flames or Shadow Atronach. So she'll have a wider variety of spells she can use in combat. Of course, she will still reanimate dead corpses all over the place!

### Overhauled NPC appearances

Tuxborn in general overhauls NPC appearances all over the place, so just about every Dawnguard NPC will have a slightly different appearance than they do in vanilla.

### Changes to the Face Sculptor

While she is not part of the Dawnguard storyline, the Face Sculptor in the Ragged Flagon was added to the game by Dawnguard, so we're documenting this here. The mod [Face Sculptor Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110116) gives this character a bit more to do:

* She now has two tiers of service she can give you, depending on whether you want her to arrange for any active bounties to be removed (on the grounds that the guards won't recognize your new appearance)
* She will get up and move around the Flagon, and interact with other NPCs
* Riften citizens may sometimes come into the Flagon in search of her services

### Adjusted Ancient Technology side quests from Sorine Jurard

Running all six of Sorine Jurard's side quests to learn how to make crossbows and exploding crossbow bolts is still required if you want to be able to do that. However, the sixth and final quest now ties into the "Night Hunter" quest in the AE, where you can acquire Elven and Ebony crossbows. So there's a better connection in our load order for the various crossbow types.

See the Crossbows section of the [Armor and weapons available in Tuxborn](Armor-and-weapons-available-in-Tuxborn/) page for more details.

### Additional content in the Soul Cairn

We're running a mod that does pretty much what it says on the tin: [More to do in the Soul Cairn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/115962). This content involves three additional NPCs who you can help in the Soul Cairn while you're there.

The custom maps we're running include one for the Soul Cairn, so hopefully you'll find it easier to navigate than in vanilla Skyrim.

If you pick up the quest to bring Jiub the pages of his book, you should get quest markers for any of the ones you haven't collected yet. Similarly, you should get a quest marker to find Arvak's skull, when you first talk to the soul of his owner.

Our load order includes the mod [Belethor's Sister](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92381), which will eventually lead you to the Soul Cairn. Because of this, we strongly recommend having that plot moved far enough along that you're ready to rescue Belethor's sister when you get there.

And last but not least, our load order includes the [G.R.I.M.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41816) mod, which overhauls the fight with the Reaper, to make it more interesting. _And_ repeatable, with escalating loot the more times you try it.

### Additional content in the Forgotten Vale

We are running the [Undead Snow Elves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87023) mod which adds, well, undead Snow Elves to the Forgotten Vale. This mod includes replacing the Falmer that carries Auriel's Shield with a unique undead Snow Elf boss, so be on the lookout for that.

Like the Soul Cairn, the Forgotten Vale should have better navigation available, and map markers.

For Legacy of the Dragonborn purposes, the Forgotten Vale is a splendid place to find Falmer excavation sites. There are bunches of them all over the Vale. In particular, several of them can be found circling the lake where you must fight [Voslaarum](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Voslaarum) and [Naaslaarum](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Naaslaarum). 

## "Does Dawnguard have displayable relics for the LOTD museum?"

Yes. _Many_. You will encounter displayable artifacts in just about all stages of Dawnguard's quest, no matter which side you're playing on. Consult the following LOTD wiki pages for further details on artifacts to look for and where they are displayed in the museum:

### General armor and weapons

* [Standard Dawnguard armor and weapons](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Armory_(SSE)#Dawnguard)

#### ‼️ Note about the Paragons ‼️

The [Ruby](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Ruby_Paragon), [Sapphire](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Sapphire_Paragon), [Amethyst](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Amethyst_Paragon), [Emerald](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Emerald_Paragon), and [Diamond](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Diamond_Paragon) paragons from the Forgotten Vale are _not_ marked as displayable items, even though there is a spot for them in the museum. They will _not_ count towards your number of displays.

If you want to display them anyway, you will need to manually place them in the [designated spot for them](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Hall_of_Lost_Empires_(SSE)#Lost_Vale_Relics), in the Hall of Lost Empires.

### Other items

* [Serana's Elder Scroll](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Elder_Scroll_(Sun))
* [Valerica's Elder Scroll](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Elder_Scroll_(Blood))

## "What recommendations are there in Tuxborn for running Dawnguard?"

### Displayable artifacts for LOTD

Note the links provided above for items displayable in the museum. If you're running on the side of the Dawnguard, run the LOTD-provided version of the [Ancient Power](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Power) quest to get the various ancient vampire parts. Also, loot _all_ dead vampires after you run Kindred Judgment for the Dawnguard side, to get the jewelry items.

Even if you don't normally run the Dawnguard side quests offered by Sorine, Gunmar, and Florentius, these _will_ get you additional items to display. So consider doing those side quests, if you want the displayable items.

You will have multiple opportunities to get a standard steel crossbow as you play through Dawnguard: getting one from Isran or Durak, asking Sorine how to make them, or looting one as you run Ruunvald to rescue Florentius. You will also learn how to make the enhanced version of those when you talk to Sorine. However, only the standard version is displayable.

After you kill Arch-Curate Vyrthur, the ancient Falmer armor he's wearing should include a crown, for a total of four pieces. LOTD's wiki refers to these pieces as Ancient Falmer Boots, Crown, Cuirass, and Gauntlets. However, since our load order includes Carved Brink, these items have been renamed. All of them should still be displayable in the museum, if you have not already run Carved Brink.

### Delrune's Dwemer Compass shortcut to return to the Glacial Crevice

If you've crafted Delrune's Dwemer Compass before coming to the Forgotten Vale, it would be worth your while to use it to mark the entrance to the Glacial Crevice for return later. This will be useful once you run the third and final excavation quest in Legacy of the Dragonborn, which will need you to return to an extra area inside that part of the Forgotten Vale.

### Followers

In vanilla Skyrim, once you reach the point of the Dawnguard plot where you need to go with Serana to Castle Volkihar to look for her mother, Serana will object to your having any other followers with her.

In Tuxborn, however, this will apply if and only if you're running vanilla followers, or Interesting NPC followers that run the vanilla code. She will _not_ object to your having any of the custom followers. Including Lydia, since Lydia is a modded follower in our load order.

While this may make running that part of the Dawnguard plot easier, especially once you get into the Soul Cairn, it will cause a plot hole. Normally _you_ can't enter the Soul Cairn unless Serana either makes you a vampire, or partially soultraps you. If you have custom followers with you at this point, though, _they_ will be able to enter the Soul Cairn without any problems.

So depending on your personal preferences for narrative cohesion, you may or may not want to dismiss any followers anyway, before you take Serana to go find her mother.

If you're running a large follower squad, this raises the chances that one or more of them may wind up getting into a fight with Serana. Serana is very prone to hitting other followers with her magical attacks, so if she gets into a spat with one or more of your followers, you may need to throw high-level calming spells around, or the `StopCombatAlarmOnActor` command in the console.

Auri has some good commentary on Dawnguard, and takes rather well to Serana out of the gate. She has one amusing interaction directly with Serana about the similarities of their (aheh) dietary habits, which uses a couple of Serana's known vanilla lines in good context. Auri's also one of the few followers with any lines that do, in fact, directly address Serana. Some of Auri's commentary on the plot you will only be able to hear by talking to her directly, so do that periodically so you don't miss out.

If you're running Lydia, she will have some Dawnguard-specific commentary you'll want to listen for. Also, due to Serana's propensity for getting aggro with followers as noted above, you should strongly consider turning on Lydia's Essential setting via her MCM.

Xelzaz has very intelligent commentary on the entire plot, starting with when you find Serana. He will follow you all the way through the Castle Volkihar ruins to Valerica's lab, and he has _splendid_ commentary when you're confronted with the options of how to get yourself into the Soul Cairn. Xelzaz so far is the only one of our custom followers known to provide an in-character reason why he will not in fact accompany you into the Soul Cairn.

Remiel is an excellent follower to bring into Dawnguard as well, as she has a _lot_ of Dawnguard-specific running commentary.

And lastly, some custom followers may have unpredictable behavior when you need to enter Castle Volkihar. They may or may not follow you in, depending on whether they've been set up to respect standard game behavior re: which locations won't let you bring in followers, and whether they have code to let them catch up with you if you get ahead of them. So don't be surprised if your custom follower seems to get lost as long as you're taking Serana home at the start of the plot, or later when you take her to find her mother.

## "Are there any potential breaking issues to watch out for while running Dawnguard?"

### Taking the Dev Aveza to Fort Dawnguard

Due to the map mods we're running in the Tuxborn load order, Dayspring Canyon now has its own custom map, and a fast travel marker similar to the ones for Wyrmstooth, Midwood Isle, Solstheim, etc. If you try to fast travel into Dayspring Canyon, it will land you at the entrance of the canyon, rather than directly at Fort Dawnguard.

And trying to take the Dev Aveza into the canyon is problematic. How problematic it is depends on what version of Tuxborn you're running.

<details>
<summary><i>If you're still running 0.5.2...</i></summary>
<br>

On Tuxborn 0.5.2, the airship won't drop its ladder low enough that you can get back to it from the ground. Also, it does not even render properly inside Dayspring Canyon, so you can't fast travel right back onto it as you normally can anywhere else in the main worldspace.
</details>

<details>
<summary><i>If you're running 1.1.3...</i></summary>
<br>

With Tuxborn 1.1.3, the behavior is somewhat but not entirely better. The airship does not actually enter the canyon, and you'll be dropped along with any followers at the canyon's entrance. However, you will be blocked from moving. This can be fixed by use of the `enableplayercontrols` command in the console.
</details>

We'll be looking at improving this behavior in Tuxborn 1.2. Until then, we advise that if you want to travel to Fort Dawnguard via the Dev Aveza, park it somewhere _near_ Dayspring Canyon. Any nearby discovered fast travel marker should do, such as Stendarr's Beacon, Heroes Rest Crypt, etc. At the very least, you can take the airship to Riften and go overland, or fast travel over from there.

### Taking the Dev Aveza to the Forgotten Vale

By contrast to Dayspring Canyon, you _can_ take the Dev Aveza into the Forgotten Vale, once you've found the first wayshrine, since that serves as a fast travel marker.

However, note that the map we have for the Vale will _not_ show the airship, so you can't fast travel directly back to it. You _can_ fast travel back to the first wayshrine, though. And the airship's boarding ladder comes down right next to the wayshrine.

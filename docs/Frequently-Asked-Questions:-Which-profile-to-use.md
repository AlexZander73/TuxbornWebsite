---

Tuxborn players often ask which of the various profiles we offer in MO2 they should use. This page is to give an overview of those profiles so you can decide.

## Overview

There are two loose groups of profiles in Tuxborn's install: the BFCO profiles, and the non-BFCO profiles. The main differences between them are:

* Combat systems used
* Combat animations used

In each of those two loose groups, there will be a Desktop, a Handheld, and a Deck profile. So you should decide:

* BFCO or not BFCO
* Desktop, Handheld, or Deck profile

The Desktop profile is recommended for PCs. Handheld is recommended for any handheld device newer than the Steam Deck. And Deck is recommended for the Steam Deck. However, these are not hard requirements. Lower-end non-Deck handhelds, or lower-end PCs, may get better performance out of using the Deck profile as well. If the Desktop or Handheld profiles do not work well for you on your computer or device, try using the Deck profile instead.

Also, if you want to try out both BFCO and non-BFCO profiles to see which you prefer, see the [Save-safe](Save‐safe/) page if you want to do such testing. As that page advises, you cannot safely switch between BFCO and not-BFCO on the same save file.

Doing at least a little bit of research and/or testing of the available profiles is recommended, as this, too, may influence your build choices.

## Differences in combat systems

| Profile type | Combat system used |
| --- | --- |
| BFCO | Combination of [Valhalla](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741) and [Plus Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100915) |
| Non-BFCO | Blade and Blunt |

Players interested in trying the BFCO profiles, note that Plus Combat is based off of Blade and Blunt, so it's going to share some of the same behaviors. But it's making several changes to them, in addition to changes done to how Valhalla handles things.

So very roughly speaking, you can think of the combat system in the BFCO profiles as "Blade and Blunt++". whereas the non-BFCO profiles are just straight up Blade and Blunt.

## Differences in combat animations

Aside from combat systems, the other main difference between the two sets of profiles is the combat animations. Both sets of profiles make extensive changes to animations all over the game, but the BFCO profiles in particular make additional changes to the ones for combat.

BFCO is in general a combat animations framework that other mods can build off of. So a bunch of the combat animations those profiles use are engaging with that framework. This is why those are called the "BFCO" profiles in our setup. Since the animation differences are a big part of the BFCO profiles, this is why we recommend third-person play on those profiles, just so that you see all of the animations--not only for NPCs, but also for _you_. Playing in first person, you'll miss out on some of the visual changes!

Also, sometimes Skyrim's AI may have issues with the provided BFCO movesets, especially in close quarters.

This doesn't mean, however, that you can't play first person with the BFCO profiles. You can! Just be aware you'll miss out on some of the animations that way.

## Differences in control mapping

The non-BFCO profiles use standard Skyrim keyboard and controller mappings.

The BFCO profiles rearrange the default mappings, though, so if you want to play any of the BFCO profiles, be aware of that. The changed mappings are called out on the main Tuxborn readme, but we'll put them here again for reference:

### Controller

- X = Dodge/Sprint
- LB = Block with 1h+Spell
- LT = Block everything else
- RB = Heavy Attack
- RT = Light Attack
- L3 = Shout/Power
- Dpad Left = Sheath Weapon
- Dpad Down = Sneak

### Keyboard

- V = Block with 1h+Spell
- Alt = Dodge/Sprint
- G = Heavy Attack
- M1 = Light Attack
- M2 = Block everything else

‼️ **Important note:** Keyboard users on any BFCO profile will need to select the Combat Keyboard Keys under Optionals and disable Tuxborn Combat Controller Input in MO2. ‼️

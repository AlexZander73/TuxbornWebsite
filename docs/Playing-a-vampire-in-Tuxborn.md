This page is an overview of information relevant to being a vampire in Tuxborn.

## "What vampire mod is Tuxborn using for its load order?"

We are running [Sacrilege](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42408) from Enairim. Refer to that mod page for details on how it overhauls vampire play in the game.

## "What do I need to do to become a vampire in Tuxborn?"

The standard means of doing this from vanilla Skyrim still applies: get infected with Sanguinare Vampiris by any vampire. 

### Vanilla vampire quests

Some base game quests to pursue that will put you up against groups of vampires include:

* A Daedra's Best Friend
* Dark Ancestor
* Laid to Rest

### Mod methods

Sacrilege adds an Alchemy recipe for a Potion of Embracing which will grant you vampirism upon consumption, unless you are immune to diseases. Requires 1 Flawless Ruby + 1 Vampire Dust.

If you acquire Krovaxis as a player home and you are not already a vampire, there's an NPC there who can infect you as well.

## "What do I need to do to become a vampire lord?"

Standard vanilla Skyrim means apply here as well. You will need to gain vampire lord status from either Harkon or Serana in Dawnguard.

Note: Krovaxis does _not_ include an option to let you become a vampire lord.

## "If I'm a vampire, can I play Dawnguard on the side of the Dawnguard?"

Nothing in our load order is known to change how vanilla Skyrim handles this. So base game behavior still applies here. Durak will absolutely not notice if you're a vampire when he makes the Dawnguard recruitment speech to you, and you can also make the initial contact with Isran.

Once you're past that point, however, Dawnguard members will not deal with you at all until you are cured. You may be directed to Falion in Morthal to deal with this, or, you could consider contracting lycanthropy to get rid of your vampirism. (Because apparently the Dawnguard does _not_ care about werewolves.)

## "Can I be a vampire and a werewolf at the same time in Tuxborn?"

Not without taking advantages of glitches in the game to do this, or Rule 11'ing your install.

Players who don't mind doing a Rule 11 may be interested in [Growl and Sacrilege Hybrid](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45939), which is intended to solve this exact problem.

## "Can I be a vampire and a lich at the same time in Tuxborn?"

Again, not without taking advantage of glitches in the game to do this.

## "Can I be a vampire and a lich and a werewolf all at the same time?"

See previous answers.

In general, we don't recommend trying to pursue more than one of these routes at once, as that's generally not the gameplay intention of either Skyrim itself or the mods we're running. 

Also, we do not have a known reliable RP path to follow that will let you do this without manipulating game glitches, or console shenanigans. We will however update this page if we can confirm a glitch-free, console-free path to take.

## "I'm trying to transform into a vampire lord, but the animation is broken!"

This has been reported on the mod page as a possible issue outside the context of Tuxborn. We do not have a known fix for it at this time, but there is a reported workaround confirmed as functional.

Try feeding on any available vampire cattle NPC. This should return your transformation animation to normal.

## "I cannot wield the Raze or Conjure Gargoyle spells when I'm in flight mode as a vampire lord!"

The workaround for feeding on any available vampire cattle NPC should work to solve this problem as well. This has been confirmed to work in Tuxborn.

## "I'm a vampire but not able to feed on sleeping NPCs, how can I fix this?"

### Disable QuickLoot solution

We've had reports that QuickLoot has interfered with the ability to feed on sleeping NPCs, and at least in one instance, a player was able to fix the problem by temporarily disabling QuickLoot in its MCM. Steps to follow would be thus:

1. Open up QuickLoot's MCM
2. Set the hotkeys to temporarily disable AND re-enable the mod
3. Use the hotkey to temporarily disable QuickLoot
4. Try to feed on your victim
5. Use the other hotkey to re-enable QuickLoot

## "Every NPC is attacking me on sight! What gives?"

If you're a vampire, check your hunger status. Once you're blood starved, then yes, NPCs will attack you on sight. This is a thing originally removed from Skyrim when Dawnguard dropped. Sacrilege puts it back in.

So pay attention to your hunger status if you want to avoid this problem.

Thanks to the following players on #txbn-general regarding information on this page:

* Kyaralys, for reporting the issue with vampire lord animation breaking, the issue with spells not wielding correctly in either hand, and the workaround that can address both

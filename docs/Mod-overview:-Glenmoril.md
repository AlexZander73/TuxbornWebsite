## "How do I launch Glenmoril?"

Glenmoril will auto-launch once you reach level 30, and you go to the main gate of Falkreath. You'll see a little girl you'll have to help, and you'll get an objective to talk to an NPC named Brandt.

## "Why do voices in Glenmoril sound weird? Are they generated by AI?"

Glenmoril was originally written in Japanese, and it's not actually completed yet. So what English voicing is available is AI-generated, yes, using the xVASynth tool.

The same team that's done English voicing acting for Vigilant and Unslaad has said they'll also do Glenmoril once it's finished.

## "Hang on, Glenmoril isn't finished?"

Correct. Act 4 is not done yet. If you don't like the idea of playing an unfinished mod (or a mod that uses AI for its voices), you may want to sit this one out.

## "How can I get back to Skyrim when I'm done playing Glenmoril?"

Look for a music box where you get off the boat ride. This music box should allow you to return to Tamriel.

Methods covered in [Means of teleportation in Tuxborn](Means-of-teleportation-in-Tuxborn/) should also work, as long as where you end up in Glenmoril satisfies the conditions for those various methods.

Last but not least, if you have trouble finding the music box or if you have no other means of self-teleportation, you can punt to using the `coc` command in the console. You'll need to know a location code for an appropriate location to return to. We recommend `coc DBMDGHallofHeroes` to put yourself back into the Hall of Heroes office in the LOTD museum, which will conveniently put you in a good spot to clear any displayable items out of your inventory.

Any other location code should work with `coc`, though. Refer to the UESP for appropriate other location codes for base game locations.

## "Why do children in Glenmoril, like Lalanoah, look so different from other Skyrim children?"

This is by design, it's part of the original mod and how Vicn envisioned them.

We are running Foamimi's mod to overhaul NPC appearances in Glenmoril, but her additional patch to cover the children doesn't apply for our load order, as we aren't running RS Children.

## "Does Glenmoril have any custom followers?"

Two: Brandt and Ozwald. However, they are temporary followers, and are only present during certain scenes. Their dialogue is not as extensive as fully custom followers such as Gore or Auri, but they do have reactions to locations specific to the mod.

## "What armor sets are available in Glenmoril?"

There are several custom armor sets available with this mod. None of them have any special abilities or enchantments, but they do have very unique looks. So if you're looking for something unusual for your Dragonborn to wear, you might have a look at these.

### Light armor

<details>
<summary><i>Details on light armor in Glenmoril...</i></summary>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

| Armor type | Material to improve | Material on deconstruct | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Assassin | Leather | Leather Strips | Close-fitting set in dark gray and ivory. Includes armor, mask, gauntlets, and boots. Main armor piece comes with a cape, so you may or may not want to wear a cloak with this. Possibly suitable for members of the Thieves Guild or Dark Brotherhood. |
| Apostate | Leather | Leather Strips | Only seems to include a mask/hat, but it does count for light armor. |
| Aradia's | Ebony | Yes | Also only seems to include a mask/hat, but again, light armor. Witch hat style with a skull mask. |
| Ashlander | Chitin Plate | Chitin Plate | Close-fitting hood and mask similar to chitin helmets on Solstheim. Comes in two variants, one with a three-part left eyepiece rather than a standard one. |
| Beast Hunter | Leather | Leather Strips | Includes coat, boots, gloves, hat, and mask. The coat and boots come in black and brown varieties, the hat is a wide-brimmed hat that sits atop the head, and the mask covers the lower half of the face. |
| Black Owl | Leather, Ebony | Leather Strips, Firewood | Mostly light armor in black and gold. Head piece comes in two variants, a hat and a mask. Back piece is a coffin but appears to function only as armor, rather than a literal coffin. Coffin piece requires ebony to improve, but all other pieces take leather. The leather items can all be deconstructed at a tanning rack. The coffin item can be deconstructed at a smelter, but it gives back firewood, rather than ebony. |
| Black Worm | Corundum, Quicksilver | Refined Moonstone | Necromancer-like light armor set that comes in two variants, regular and silver. The regular version requires corundum to improve, and the silver version requires quicksilver. |
| Brethren Hunter | Leather | Leather Strips | Shades of blue, brown, and ivory. Comes with a wide-brimmed hat of a jauntier design than the Beast Hunter one, coat, gloves, and boots. |
| Chaplain | Leather, Iron | Leather Strips | Modest light armor set in grays and browns that would befit a religious Dragonborn. Mask is separate from the hood, and comes in two variants, a regular one that works with the hood and an iron one that does not. All pieces can be deconstructed for leather strips at a tanning rack, even the iron mask, even though the iron mask requires iron to improve. |
| Chick Trader | Leather | Leather Strips | Looks identical in style to the Witch Hunter set, only in different colors. Includes a cloak, although the cloak clips oddly with the armor.<sup>4</sup>|
| Chief Assassin | Leather | Leather Strips | Very similar to the Assassin armor in style, just in different colors, brown, cream, and ivory. |
| Copper Ardeo | Corundum | Refined Moonstone | Looks like a giant traffic cone when placed on your head. |
| Enlarged Head | Human Flesh | Ebony | Looks like a giant, goopy brain with a lot of eyeballs poking out of it. |
| Falkreath Guard Vice-Captain | Steel | Steel | Variant on Falkreath-style guard armor, with chain mail. Has two variants of the helmet.|
| Gulakhan | Chitin Plate | None | Reminiscent of bonemold armor on Solstheim, but in darker colors. |
| Gold Ardeo | Gold | Refined Moonstone | Gold version of the Copper Ardeo. |
| Hamah's Iron Mask | Iron | Iron | Head piece that conceals the entire head. |
| Hircine's Helmet | Briar Heart | None | Your Health Regeneration is increased by 30%. Your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 30%. Your Carry Weight is increased by 50.<sup>6</sup> <sup>7</sup>|
| Huntress | Leather | Leather Strips | As with above armor sets, includes hat, coat, gloves, and boots. This one is in shades of black and red with accents of brass, and the hat is a tricorne style. |
| Institute Agent | Leather | Leather Strips | Looks like modified Thalmor mage robes. Head piece is a gas mask. |
| Institute Officer | Leather | Leather Strips | Looks like slightly more ornate modified Thalmor mage robes. Head piece is a jagged skull mask. |
| Knight of Radiance | Steel | Steel | No special abilities or enchantments. |
| Marionette | Steel | Steel | Eight total pieces. Armor comes in dark and white variants. Boots have heels if worn by females. The head piece has four varieties. | 
| Mask of Hircine | Briar Heart | None | Your Magicka Regeneration is increased by 30%. Your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 30%. Your Carry Weight is increased by 50. <sup>6</sup> <sup>8</sup> |
| Mayor | Leather | Leather Strips | Only two pieces in this set, Mayor Garb and Mayor Hat, but the Garb covers the entire body. Very ornate, and not sure why this is classed as light armor instead of clothing, but sure roll with it. |
| Overgrown Crimson Nirnroot | Crimson Nirnroot | Ebony | Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%. Your Magicka Regeneration is increased by 50%. Your Magicka is increased by 150.<sup>5</sup>|
| Overgrown Nirnroot | Nirnroot | Ebony | Your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%. Your Health Regeneration is increased by 50%. Your Health is increased by 150.<sup>5</sup>|
| Pailune Musketeer | Leather | Leather Strips | Very ornate style. Includes hat/mask, coat, gloves, and boots. The hat and mask are a single piece, so you can't wear one without the other. The mask is a stylized bird face in ivory. |
| Plague Doctor | Leather | Leather Strips | Close-fitting armor set in grays and browns. Hood keeps the face visible, while the mask is beak-shaped and fully hides the face. |
| Silver Ardeo | Silver | Refined Moonstone | Silver version of the Copper Ardeo. |
| Theologian | Leather | Leather Strips | Very loose-fitting religious-looking armor set in gray and white. Has a regular hood but also hood variants, with different colored masks. |
| Undead Hunter | Bone Meal | Refined Moonstone | Very spiky, mostly steel and bone. Helmet is a skull on your head. |
| Witch Hunter | Leather | Leather Strips | Understated in style compared to the other sets, close to Beast Hunter in look, with a long coat, two variants of hat, mask, gloves, and boots. Overall colors are dark gray and tan, with brown leather trim. The mask is another one that covers the lower half of the face. The hat variants are a tricorne and a top hat. |
| Yelem School | Dwarven Metal | Dwarven Metal | Dwemer-ish light armor set, with metal parts mostly around the head and chest.|
| Yellow | Leather | Leather Strips | Looks to be mostly made of bandages, in shades of bright yellow and purple. Does some _very_ strange distortion of your head. |

General notes:
1. Unless an item on this list takes material other than leather to improve, you should be able to deconstruct it at a tanning rack. Otherwise, you will need to use a smelter.
2. Depending on what hairstyle you're using, you may see clipping issues with some of the hats. Experimentation is advised to choose the one that looks best with your character.
3. Female Dragonborns may find that your chest is noticeably larger when trying these armor sets. Root cause of this appears to be the Glenmoril CBBE patch in our load order.
4. Also, given what the chick traders actually are in Glenmoril (i.e., slavers), you may or may not want to wear an armor set named after them. Your call!
5. Cannot be disenchanted or enchanted.
6. Item cannot be deconstructed at a smelter.
7. Item teaches the Hircine's Blessing enchantment when disenchanted. Which is recommended, as this is a very tasty enchantment.
7. Item teaches the Blessing of Hircine enchantment when disenchanted. Which is recommended, as this is a very tasty enchantment.

### Heavy armor

<details>
<summary><i>Details on heavy armor in Glenmoril...</i></summary>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

| Armor type | Material to improve | Material on deconstruct | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anequina | Refined Moonstone | Steel | Mostly looks like the Wolf armor set for the Companions, but with a Khajiit-style helmet. |
| Arcane Cage | Iron | Steel | Only includes a "helmet", for values of "helmet" meaning "for some reason you have a literal cage on your head". (May make more actual sense if you run Glenmoril.)|
| Ashkan | Chitin Plate | Bone Meal | Looks like a variant of Orcish armor, but with decoration to fit the Ashlander tribes of Morrowind. |
| Champion of Anequina | Refined Moonstone | Refined Moonstone | Looks like an ebony armor variant, but required Refined Moonstone to improve, and yields Refined Moonstone if you smelt it down. |
| Ghost Knight | Steel | Steel | Looks appropriate for religious characters/paladins to use. Armor comes with a regular and a red variant; other pieces are in shades of gray and brown. |
| Nord Warrior | Orichalcum | Steel | In shades of green and brown. May be intended for forest-based camouflage? Helmet has a full face mask. |
| Orcish Archer Helmet | Orichalcum | Orichalcum | No special abilities or enchantments. |
| Orcish Chief Helmet | Orichalcum | Orichalcum | No special abilities or enchantments. |
| Void Keeper | Ebony | Ebony | Skeletal-themed armor set in shades of black, gray, and very dark reddish-brown. Head piece is a skull mask. Chest piece looks like a rib cage.|
| Wraith | Steel | Steel | Not a full armor set, just includes four variants on steel head pieces, all of which look like bloodied or rusted steel to varying degrees.<sup>1</sup>|

General notes:
1. The mask piece is classed as a circlet in inventory, but still counts as Heavy Armor, so listing it on this table.

## "What weapons are available in Glenmoril?"

There are a wide variety of weapons available in Glenmoril. Most notably, Glenmoril is one of two mods in Tuxborn that offers guns as potential weapons for the player. The guns come in one- and two-handed varieties, although how they are classed in your inventory depends on the specific gun.

In all tables, note that there are several cases where the material needed to improve an item is _not_ the same material you get back if you deconstruct it. Cases where this applies are marked with the format X/Y in the relevant table column.

See below sections for more details.

4. Teaches standard Chaos Damage enchantment if disenchanted.
5. Presumably an ingredient only available in Glenmoril.

7. Description is misleading. The power "Trick: Shotshell" activates if you wield the weapon in either hand.
8. Description is misleading. The power "Trick: Quicksilver Bullet" activates if you wield the weapon in either hand.

### Staves and pistols

Glenmoril appears to class its one-handed guns (generally, pistols) as "staves", so we're putting them into a separate table here. Along with any actual staves, as well as one-handed guns classed as other types of weapons.

Unless otherwise specified, pistols classed as staves on this table cannot be improved at a grindstone, since the base game does not allow for tempering of staves. (But see below for more info on improving the pistols.) Most of them also cannot be deconstructed, although there are exceptions (see the Material to improve/deconstruct column for specifics).

<details>
<summary><i>Details on staves and pistols in Glenmoril...</i></summary>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

| Weapon name | Material to improve/deconstruct | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aetherium Beam Emitter | None | Target takes 60 points of shock damage per second to Health, and half that to Magicka. Looks like a chonky Dwemer metal pistol. |

| Augur of Abyss | None | Sprays tentacles on the ground, poisoning and staggering incoming enemies. |

| Elven Pistol | None/Refined Moonstone | Does 25 points of damage to Health and Magicka.<sup>3</sup> |

| Yelem School Steam Pistol | None/Dwarven Metal | Does 80 points of damage to Health and Magicka. Comes in regular and scoped variants, but the difference between the two is purely cosmetic.<sup>3</sup> |

General notes:
1. Name is probably a reference to [Jills](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Bestiary_J#Jill) in Elder Scrolls lore.
2. Adds the Trick: Shotshell power to your Powers list. Description is misleading, though, as the power becomes active if the weapon is equipped in either hand.
3. Item cannot be disenchanted.
4. ESO players know who this is: [the leader of the Aldmeri Dominion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ayrenn) in the Second Era, as portrayed on ESO.

#### Improving pistols

Pistols cannot be improved at a grindstone, as most weapons in Skyrim can. However, certain pistols can be improved at a forge, if you have one of them in your inventory as well as any other required materials. So far, this is confirmed to work for Witch Hunter Pistols, which can be improved a total of four times at a forge to increase how much damage they do.

We'll update this note appropriately as this is confirmed for other pistol types.

General notes:
1. That said, this warhammer does not have any carry weight restriction on it, so RP that as you will.
2. _Not_ quite the same enchantment as Ahdizal's Frost Bow. May be disenchantable.
3. _Not_ quite the same enchantment as Ahzidal's Shock Bow. May be disenchantable.
4. This appears to be the standard Fire Damage enchantment. Object is disenchantable.
5. This appears to be the Damage Stamina enchantment. Object is disenchantable.
6. Presumably an ingredient found while playing Glenmoril.

### Crossbows and rifles

<details>
<summary><i>Details of crossbows and rifles in Glenmoril...</i></summary>
<br>
<p>Note that we are putting crossbows and rifles into the same table here. Glenmoril is counting most two-handed guns as rifles, and those are classed as Crossbows when viewed in your inventory. Certain other items with Rifle in the name are classed as Battleaxes, but noting those on this table too.</p>

| Weapon name | Material to improve/deconstruct | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 16-D Mathematics Cannon | Ebony | Armor penetration: 75%, Reload speed: -35%. Especially effective against dragons. |
| Aba-Kam | Steel | Armor penetration: 70%, Reload speed: -20%. |
| Anti-Jillian<sup>2</sup> Rifle | Ebony | Armor Penetration: 60%, Reload speed +30%. Especially effective against dragons.<sup>3</sup> |
| Assassin Crossbow | Steel | Ignores 50% of armor, similar to vanilla enhanced Steel crossbows. |
| Beast Hunter Rifle | Steel | Armor penetration: 50%, Reload speed: +15%. Especially effective against beasts. |
| Beast Hunter Rifle (Bronze) | Dwarven Metal/Steel | Armor penetration: 50%, Reload speed: +20%. Especially effective against beasts. |
| Beast Hunter Rifle (Silver) | Quicksilver/Steel | Armor penetration: 50%, Reload speed: +20%. Especially effective against beasts. |
| Elven Rifle | Refined Moonstone/Steel | Armor penetration: 50%, Reload speed: +10%.<sup>3</sup> |

| Mystic Warmth Rifle | Human Heart/Ebony | Armor Penetration: 60%, Reload speed: +30%.<sup>3</sup> |
| Trumpet of Queen Ayrenn | Refined Moonstone/Steel | Armor Penetration: 55%, Reload Speed: -10%.<sup>3</sup> |

| Yelem School Steam Sniper Rifle | Dwarven Metal/Steel | Armor Penetration: 70%, Reload speed: +5%.<sup>3</sup> |

General notes:
1. Description on this is misleading. It's a two-handed weapon so by definition, it will be wielded in _both_ hands. Adds a Lesser Power to your powers list that fires an explosive with it, but this only works if the weapon is actively wielded. Does not appear to consume ammo.|
2. Probable reference to [Jills](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Bestiary_J#Jill) in Elder Scrolls lore.
3. Cannot be disenchanted.

#### Improving rifles

Unlike the one-handed pistols, rifles from Glenmoril _can_ be improved at a grindstone as long as you have appropriate materials.
</details>

### Ammo

Several types of ammunition are craftable at any forge, and Glenmoril's guns are what that ammunition is for. The various ammunition types take different materials to make, and will be impacted by what perks you've unlocked in Smithing. So be sure to review which ammo types you might be interested in, and make sure you have relevant perks and materials to make those types.

If you do not care to make ammo yourself, Nostos the vendor carries a lot of ammo you can purchase from him.

## "What are the Glenmoril items related to Ahzidal?"

Players familiar with Dragonborn will recognize Ahzidal as the name of the dragon priest in Kolbjorn Barrow on Solstheim. Glenmoril has a large number of items related to him, so they get their own section on this page.

<details>
<summary><i>Details on Ahzidal items in Glenmoril...</i></summary>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

| Item | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Ahzidal's Chaos Greatsword | Target is affected by chaos and takes 40 points of magic damage.<sup>2</sup>|

The Kolbjorn Barrow version is a displayable artifact for the LOTD museum, but this one is <i>not</i>. Can be improved with an ebony ingot, or smelted to get back an ebony ingot. |
| Ahzidal's Shock Bow | Target takes 30 points of shock damage per second to Health, and half that to magicka.<sup>8</sup>|

3. _Can_ be disenchanted. Teaches the enchantment Ahzidal's Flame.

## "Where can I find the Glenmoril vendor?"

Items in Glenmoril are sold by a vendor, Nostos, who spawns at the [Roadside Ruins](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Roadside_Ruins) as soon as you hit level 30. If you're not familiar with the location, it is a short distance roughly northwest of Falkreath, and north-ish of the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary. It's along the same road that runs past the Sanctuary. Keep following that road a short ways north and you should find it to the west of the road.

Nostos sits in the center of the ruins, along with his dog. He sells a wide variety of items (possibly everything in the mod). All items listed further up the page are ones confirmed to be in Nostos' sale inventory. In addition to those things, he also sells the following:

* An assortment of books, including:
    * Black Book: Debug (contains some quest ID information)
    * Black Book: KRMT, a Speech skill book
    * Black Book: Manners of Communion (contains information on how to replay a completed Glenmoril quest)
    * Four skill books for Alteration

## "If I skip running the mod, can I still get items from it?"

Yes. Nostos will be available even if you haven't formally launched the mod, so you can swing by the Roadside Ruins at your convenience to see what he's selling.

## "What other recommendations are there for running Glenmoril?"

Due to Act 4 not being done yet, we recommend not starting Glenmoril until you have a guaranteed in-game means to teleport yourself back to the location of your choosing. This is in case you have trouble finding the music box mentioned above.

We also recommend not running Glenmoril until after you've run Vigilant, if you want to go by the recommended narrative order.

This page is an overview of information relevant to being a werecreature in Tuxborn.

## "What werecreature mods is Tuxborn using in its load order?"

We are running three relevant to being werecreatures:

* [Growl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245) from Enairim: general werewolf overhaul
* [Canis Hysteria](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52397): adds a transmissible Canis Hysteria disease to the game
* [Tales of Skyrim - Berserkyr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103559): gives the player a path to becoming a werebear, and joining a related faction

## "What do I need to do to become a werewolf in Tuxborn? Do I still need to join the Companions?"

Becoming a werewolf via the Companions questline still works. But in our load order, it is not required, and it is not the only means available. Other means of becoming a werewolf include:

* As soon as you reach level 5, if you sleep anywhere outside, you will have a nightmare that's a vision from Hircine. If you accept the opportunity given as part of the vision, you will become a werewolf.
* Werebeast Blood is an alchemical ingredient you may occasionally encounter. Ingesting this will let you become a werewolf.
* You may contract Canis Hysteria from any werewolves you fight in the wild.

Note that additional Howls available to you by running Aela the Huntress' Totems of Hircine quests are _not_ available outside the context of those quests. Growl does not give you standalone access to them, which is by design of the mod creator. So if you want those additional Howls, joining the Companions is still recommended. If you're already a werewolf when you join, the Companions questline should have new dialogue that accounts for this.

## "What do I do if I no longer want to be a werewolf?"

If you gained the beastblood via the Companions questline, you will still need to use the vanilla method of throwing a Glenmoril witch head into the flame in Ysgramor's Tomb.

If you were infected with Canis Hysteria, you will need to follow that mod's path for curing yourself. It involves finding a book called Taxonomy of Lycanthropic Diseases, which can appear as random loot in the world. A guaranteed copy of it can be found in Kodlak's room in Jorrvaskr.

(TBD: what you must do to give up the beastblood if you accepted it via Hircine's vision, or if you ingested Werebeast Blood.)

## "What do I need to do to become a werebear?"

Our load order includes a patch that disables Growl's route to becoming a werebear, in favor of the route expected by Tales of Skyrim - Berserkyr. If you want to be a werebear specifically, go to the Four Shields tavern in Dragonbridge, and look for an NPC who'll have a job for you. 

The patch will, however, still allow for werebear players to have access to some of Growl's quality of life improvements for werecreatures. ([Source](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5932))

## "What do I need to do if I no longer want to be a werebear?"

So far, the only known means to do this is to accept lycanthropy via the Companions questline, which will lift the Berserker's Curse.

It is unknown whether becoming a vampire, especially becoming a vampire lord, will also lift the curse. We will update this page if we confirm one way or another.

## "Can I be a werebear and a werewolf at the same time?"

It depends on how you get your lycanthropy.

As per the mod page for Tales of Skyrim - Berserkyr, if you get your lycanthropy via the Companions, if you're a werebear at the time, the Companions' lycanthropy will take precedence. And you would not be able to return to being a werebear after running the Companions questline, so plan wisely. The mod page for Tales of Skyrim - Bersekyr warns that you can do the ritual to become a werebear only once.

Means of becoming a werewolf via Growl _may_ (we say _may_ here because we have only one known player who's done this) work to allow you to be a werewolf and a werebear at the same time. The most likely means for this scenario would be deliberately ingesting Werebeast Blood. At least one Tuxborn player has confirmed this happening, which resulted in his being able to transform into a werewolf via the appropriate power, and into a werebear when his health got too low.

In this scenario, deliberate werebear transformation could in theory be triggered by consuming Bear's Paw, a blue-tipped mushroom added into the game via the Berserkyr mod. And blocking werebear transformation on low health could be done by wearing an Amulet of Tsun.

## "Can I be a werecreature and a vampire at the same time in Tuxborn?"

Not without taking advantages of glitches in the game to do this, or Rule 11'ing your install.

Players who don't mind doing a Rule 11 may be interested in [Growl and Sacrilege Hybrid](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45939), which is intended to solve this exact problem. The intent of this mod is to cover simultaneous werewolf and vampire, however. So don't expect this to work for werebear/vampire.

This page covers questions pertinent to upgrading Tuxborn from any older version.

## "What is the current released version of Tuxborn?"

Tuxborn's current release is 1.1.3.

## "I have an older build of Tuxborn. Should I upgrade?"

In general, yes, it's a good idea to upgrade to the latest build available if you don't have a playthrough in progress that you care about keeping. If you _do_ have a playthrough in progress, use this page for reference about what issues you should expect if you want to finish up that playthrough.

### Quick reference

| What version of Tuxborn do you have? | Then you should... | Save safe for latest build? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.5.2 | Definitely upgrade, for improved stability and performance, especially in LOTD for Steam Decks | No |
| 1.0 | Upgrade, to avoid crashing issues with Dragon War and with Legacy of the Dragonborn Achievements | No |
| 1.1 | Upgrade to latest so you'll have the hotfix for Shades of Mortality | Yes |
| 1.1.1 | Upgrade if you want to be on latest, but not critical if you don't | Yes |
| 1.1.2 | Upgrade if you want to be on latest, but not critical if you don't | Yes |

More details for the various builds are listed below.

## Info for 0.5.2

Pros of upgrading:
- If you're a Steam Deck player, you'll be able to take advantage of performance improvements in the Legacy of the Dragonborn museum
- You will be able to move onto a version of Tuxborn under active support

Cons of upgrading:
- If you like some of the mods that were only in Tuxborn's 0.5.2 build, such as Nether's Follower Framework or Wintersun, you will lose those in later builds
- You will have to give up any playthroughs you still have in progress on 0.5.2, since upgrading will not be save safe (unless you have enough drive space available to do a separate Tuxborn install)

We recommend staying on 0.5.2 if and _only_ if:
- You don't have enough storage space to allow for a second, more recent install of Tuxborn
- You have an active playthrough in progress you're still enjoying playing
- You are playing on something besides a Steam Deck and not impacted by the Legacy of the Dragonborn performance issues in that build
- Or, you _are_ playing on a Steam Deck and are prepared to deal with the performance issues
- You're prepared to handle 0.5.2 no longer being supported, and to try to fix any problems with it on your own

Otherwise, we strongly recommend upgrading. Consider the listed pros and cons when making your call on this!

Upgrading to latest from 0.5.2 is definitely not save safe.

## Info for 1.0 or 1.0.1

There were two significant issues to be aware of for this set of builds, which were:

* Dragon War caused crashes, and was removed in 1.1
* The Legacy of the Dragonborn Achievements mod caused issues on all supported platforms and profiles, by making load times for previous saves progressively longer

If and _only_ if:
* You have a playthrough in progress you care about keeping
* You are not experiencing the Dragon War crashes
* You've installed the 1.0.1 hotfix _or_ manually disabled the Legacy of the Dragonborn Achievements mod

... then it's okay to keep your 1.0 playthrough in progress. Otherwise we recommend you upgrade.

Upgrading from 1.0.x to latest is not save safe.

## Info for 1.1, 1.1.1, and 1.1.2

If you installed 1.1 but have not gotten the 1.1.1 hotfix or the 1.1.2 release, you should go ahead and upgrade. The 1.1.1 hotfix fixed an issue with Shades of Mortality not working correctly in 1.1.

If you're on 1.1.1, it is not super critical for you to upgrade to 1.1.2 or 1.1.3, as the fixes in both of those releases were minor. But if you don't have a playthrough in progress, no reason not to upgrade.

Upgrading from 1.1, 1.1.1, or 1.1.2 to latest should be save safe.

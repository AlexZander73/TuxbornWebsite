Tuxborn's overall light levels tend to skew a bit dark, so this page is to offer some guidance to players on how to adjust for this.

## "What device settings can I adjust for light levels?"

These will vary depending on what platform you're playing on. But in general, just about all players should have some sort of brightness display setting at the operating system level that you can adjust if you wish.

## "What game settings can I adjust for light levels?"

Within Skyrim's settings, there is a brightness slider under Settings > Display.

And within Tuxborn in particular, we include a mod called Azurite. This gives you a power in your powers list called Azurite Meditation. Activating this will open a UI that will allow you to adjust color and lighting levels in a variety of situations. We encourage experimenting with this UI to adjust things to your liking, if you want to avoid using operating system settings which might impact other things you do on your computer or handheld.

The MCM for Legacy of the Dragonborn includes a setting for light levels inside the Dragonborn Gallery in particular. So if you find that the rest of the game looks fine, but your museum seems dark, try setting that setting to the brightest possible value.

## "What light sources are available in-game in Tuxborn?"

We have a variety of options for light sources your Dragonborn can use:

### Carryable items

* Base game torches, which are frequently available in the following scenarios:
    * Lootable off of slain guards or soldiers
    * Lootable from some torch sconces in dungeons or other locations, such as Embershard Mine or the East Empire Company Warehouse
* Base game Staff of Magelight still exists, and you will be guaranteed one as you run the College of Winterhold plot
* Sands' Torch, an infinite torch available via the Tools of the Trade quest in Legacy of the Dragonborn (see [Quests in Legacy of the Dragonborn](Quests-in-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) for further details)
* Arden-Sul's Heart from the Identity Crisis mod, which can act as a light source

### Spells

Relevant base game spells are:

* Candlelight
* Magelight
* Stendarr's Aura, which is primarily a defensive spell against undead. But it also casts light, so it can be used as a light source in a pinch

### Craftable and/or wearable items

* Craftable lanterns provided by the [Simple Wearable Lanterns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58464) mod
* You may periodically find a Circlet of Light or Necklace of Light as random loot, or sold by vendors. These basically are wearable versions of the Candlelight spell, and unlike the spell, they will _not_ expire, they will be active as long as you're wearing them
* Potions of Light are craftable at alchemy tables, if you have appropriate ingredients. See the UESP page on [light in Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Light) for a list of relevant ingredients. Generally these will be ones available via the Rare Curios creation, and they can be acquired in the following ways:
    * Purchased from Khajiit merchants
    * Freely harvestable in the Shivering Isles as you run Saints and Seducers Extended Cut
    * Purchasable from the Dremora Merchant if you acquire the Black Market power from the Black Book Untold Legends on Solstheim

### Other

If you happen to have a weapon with a Sun enchantment on it, that enchantment's primary purpose is doing damage to the undead. But as long as you have the weapon wielded and unsheathed, it will _also_ cast a modest amount of light. So it can be a sneaky backdoor light source, too.

Notably, this will include Dawnbreaker, since Artificer adjusts Dawnbreaker to do Sun damage.

## "How do I craft a lantern?"

You can craft any of the three available lantern types at a forge, as long as you have the relevant materials:

* Iron lantern: 2 iron ingots, 1 linen wrap, 1 fire salts
* Magic lantern: 2 corundum ingots, 1 filled common soul gem, 1 glow dust
* Alchemist's lantern: 2 silver ingots, 1 taproot, 1 hanging moss

Of the three, you will most likely be able to create an iron ingot first. Linen wraps should be freely available in any draugr barrow, and iron ingots can be either bought or created by melting down acquired loot items at a smelter. This leaves only the fire salts, so be on the lookout for those either as loot, or when you're buying items from alchemists.

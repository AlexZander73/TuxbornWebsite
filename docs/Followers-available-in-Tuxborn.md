This page covers all the known custom followers available in the Tuxborn modpack, including commentary on how to find them, which followers to choose for which roles, how well they react to various quests, and how well they interact with other followers.

Overall, there are a whole lot of custom followers available in Tuxborn, several via their own standalone mods, and many more available via Interesting NPCs.

This list is _definitely_ not exhaustive, but we'll try to keep it as up to date as possible.

Several of our most popular followers have their own pages on this wiki, so you won't see them covered here. Those follower overview pages include [Follower overview: Auri](Follower-overview:-Auri/), [Follower overview: Aviendha](Follower-overview:-Aviendha/), [Follower overview: Gore](Follower-overview:-Gore/), [Follower overview: Lucien](Follower-overview:-Lucien/), [Follower overview: Lydia](Follower-overview:-Lydia/), [Follower overview: Remiel](Follower-overview:-Remiel/), and [Follower overview: Xelzaz](Follower-overview:-Xelzaz/).

## Follower framework

Tuxborn's follower framework is UMF, [Underwhelming Multiple Followers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25745), which is by and large only really applicable to vanilla followers. Adding custom followers to it is _not_ recommended.

However, UMF can manage any vanilla followers, _or_ any mod followers that are known to use the vanilla code. For example, any Interesting NPCs followers. This includes the ability to summon followers UMF knows about. Please note that UMF maxes out at three vanilla or vanilla-compatible followers, so choose and manage your followers appropriately.

Consult the provided Nexus link for more info on how UMF works.

## How many followers you can run at once

As noted above, UMF can manage up to three followers at once, as long as they're running vanilla code. This basically means, any of the known vanilla followers, plus followers provided by the Interesting NPCs mod.

Pretty much every other follower in Tuxborn is going to have their own custom follower code. And none of those followers care about how many other followers you may happen to have. In fact, several followers will actually have additional dialogue depending on who else you're running! See details on the various follower overview pages, for tips on which custom followers are good to run in combo with others.

So for all intents and purposes, you can run pretty much as many followers as you like. It's entirely up to you.

## Summoning followers to you if they get lost

Just about all of the custom followers in Tuxborn have their own custom AIs. Methods vary on how to summon a custom follower back to you, if they get separated from you.

Generally, however, this will be either a spell you can cast, or a power you can invoke from your Powers menu. Follower overview pages will note the appropriate method to summon the follower, if the method to do so for them is known.

You may wish to add such spells and/or powers to your Favorites. Steam Deck players in particular may wish to assign the resulting Favorite hotkeys to any available back button, _or_ set up a radial menu to be launched off a trackpad.

UMF includes a "Check" command that should port any missing followers it knows about to you. And the MCM for UMF allows for assigning a hotkey to that command. So as with the various custom follower means of summons, having that on a hotkey means you can put it on your Favorites.

## Content that expects no followers

There are certain points in the vanilla game, as well as in the various quest mods included in Tuxborn's load order, that expect you to _not_ have any followers with you. And since several of the followers in our load order have custom AI, they will very likely follow you into such content anyway. This may break your RP immersion.

So be mindful of this, and dismiss followers as necessary when you want to run such content. Note that Auri in particular has been reported to be _particularly_ prone to following you into such content. So if you favor Auri as a follower, be aware of this.

<details>
<summary><i>Known content where it's a bad idea to have followers with you...</i></summary>
<br>

<p>Content known to be a risk of this includes:<p>

* Most of Dawnguard: If you have a vanilla follower with you when you take Serana to Castle Volkihar to search for her mother, Serana will refuse to follow you. She will not, however, be aware of any custom followers. So for RP purposes, if nothing else, you may need to dismiss custom followers on your own, if you want to maintain the idea of Serana refusing to go anywhere with you if you have other people around she doesn't trust.
* Cidhna Mine: Gore and Remiel are both known to react to you being thrown into Cidhna Mine and behave as if they're arrested and thrown in with you. Other followers may just port in to join you, which can be extremely weird if you're supposed to be a prisoner and you wind up having multiple armed and armored followers with you!
* Forgotten City: Without getting into spoilers, this mod very, very much expects you to be alone, and one big part of it towards the end in particular makes little sense if you have anyone at all following you.
* Project AHO: Again, avoiding spoilers, this mod's entire point is pretty much built around you being by yourself. You can't trigger Project AHO in Tuxborn by accident, you have to go looking for it. So since you have that opportunity, dismiss followers appropriately _first_ before you launch this mod.
* Warden of the Coast: This mod provides you with several NPCs that can be followers as part of its story, and its page on Nexus explicitly recommends against bringing in your own followers.
* The Wheels of Lull: This mod doesn't prevent you from bringing followers, but due to how it's designed, having more than one or two followers will make running this mod more difficult. See the [Mod overview: Wheels of Lull](Mod-overview:-Wheels-of-Lull/) page for more details.
* Vigilant: This mod is very much considered to be end-game content, and by its very nature, not really appropriate to run with most followers. Of the custom followers in Tuxborn, only Gore and Auri are known to be set up to interact with this mod, so you can consider bringing either of them if you want. In Gore's specific case, just be prepared for intense storytelling as a result.

## Followers by content commentary

Consult the [Followers by content commentary](Followers-by-content-commentary/) page for an overview of how various custom followers are known to respond to content in the Tuxborn load order.

## Followers by location

See [Followers by location](Followers-by-location/) for a reference guide as to where various major followers are located.

## Followers by recommended role

Here's a list of followers known to be good for specific roles, to help you in your squad recruiting choices. I've included a "multiple roles" section in this list as well, which currently includes Lucien and Xelzaz. Lucien is very flexible in terms of training. Xelzaz's fighting style can be customized, but he is also a specialist in unusual potions, and can also cast Healing Hands on the player.

<details>

## Glenmoril followers

Information on the temporary followers available in Glenmoril can be found on the [Mod overview: Glenmoril](Mod-overview:-Glenmoril/) page.

## Inigo

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of Inigo...</i></summary>
<br>

<p>Inigo is another very well-loved and popular follower, featuring considerable commentary about many aspects of the game as well as lots of interactions with other custom followers. He is a Khajiit who's a former skooma junkie, and this gives some unique aspects to his interactions with <i>you</i>. To pick him up as a follower, you can find a note he's left for you on the bar in the Bee and Barb, or you can just go directly to the jail in Riften.</p>

He is _particularly_ entertaining if you're also running Lucien, as the two of them have great comedic chemistry with each other. And he's also an excellent follower to have with you if you're running Moonpath to Elsweyr, just to hear him taunting the Thalmor.

One detail about him which may or may not appeal to you, YMMV: he takes strong issue with the player's absorbing dragon souls, treating that very similarly to skooma addiction. Given that the Dragonborn can't exactly _not_ absorb dragon souls, Inigo's scolding you about this can't be stopped, and he does eventually get very stringent about it.

Inigo has a custom "whistle" ability you can use if you get separated from him.

## Interesting NPCs followers

See [Mod overview: Interesting NPCs](Mod-overview:-Interesting-NPCs/) for more info.

## Jesper

<details>
<summary>Overview of Jesper...</summary>
<p>Jesper is a Whiterun guard you can find hanging out in the Bannered Mare. He is hands down the easiest follower to recruit: you just ask him to follow you, and he does.</p>

He runs the exact same follower code as Lucien, as his creator worked with Lucien's creator to set Jesper up. So if you're familiar with how Lucien works, Jesper will work the same way.

Character-wise, this boy is not exactly well-looked-on by his fellow guards, and appears to really want to be a bard at heart. You'll hear him singing at random points in the Bannered Mare, even before you recruit him, and the guy _does_ have pipes!

But he also seems to be a very simple sort of character, and very much a cinnamon roll. If this appeals to you, or if you like the idea of maybe helping him achieve becoming a bard, consider picking him up. He'll probably work best for Dragonborns who are likewise good guys/girls, or perhaps "rogues with hearts of gold" type Dragonborns. More nefarious Dragonborns, or even players who just don't like the idea of having walking Golden Retriever Puppy type lads as followers, may go from zero to "I will stab this guy the next time he opens his mouth" very quickly. ;D

He's a good option to consider, though, if you're trying to put together a posse to help you go take out Mirmulnir at the watchtower. If you do recruit him, be sure to give him weapons. His fellow guards have saddled him with a wooden sword, and until he has actual weapons, he won't be very useful to you.

Jesper does come with a spell you can use to summon him, although he is not carrying it on his person, and does not mention it when you recruit him. The spellbook, however, is easily acquired. Check around on the left side of Dragonsreach, and you will find the spellbook and a wooden sword on one of the rocks there. You can also find a copy of the spellbook in the Bannered Mare, behind the counter.
</details>

## Katana

<details>
<summary>Overview of Katana...</summary>
<p>Katana is technically a package deal--because if you recruit her, her initial quest will eventually lead you to picking up Megara and Shale as additional followers. But at least right out of the gate, <i>particularly</i> if you start your playthrough in Solitude (for example, if you do the Relic Hunter start), she's a very strong early game follower to pick up.</p>

Note that Katana is armed with a rifle. Her rifle is _not_ acquirable by the player, or craftable. See the [Armor and weapons available in Tuxborn](Armor-and-weapons-available-in-Tuxborn/) page for info on what guns _are_ available in Tuxborn.

When she enters combat, she will frequently teleport to the nearest opponent to deliver a sneak attack. While this is not an ability available in regular Skyrim, ESO Nightblade players should find this very familiar.

Katana is very reactive to events in the game, as well as your own personal state. She will frequently comment if you're overloaded with inventory, or if your health is low.

She _cannot_ be romanced. As per her creator, she is canonically partnered with Megara. However, once you meet Shale, he _is_ a romance option.

Once you recruit her, she will give you a Mystical Feather which grants you a power on your Powers menu that you can use to summon her, if you and she get separated.

## Legacy of the Dragonborn followers

Full details on Legacy of the Dragonborn followers are available on the [Frequently Asked Questions: Legacy of the Dragonborn](Frequently-Asked-Questions:-Legacy-of-the-Dragonborn/) page.

## Melana

<details>
<summary>Overview of Melana...</summary>
<p>Melana's big selling point as a follower is that she evolves, starting off as a fragile maiden you rescue from bandits, and eventually becoming a warrior in her own right. Be advised that her "fragile maiden" stage is very, <i>very</i> fragile, so YMMV on whether this works for you.</p>

The quest to find her will auto-launch as soon as you enter Dead Man's Drink in Falkreath; you can't avoid that. So if you want to avoid picking her up as a follower, you might consider just ignoring that quest objective, and staying away from Bannermist Tower.

To get Melana to progress, you can spar with her to try to train her in weaponry. Be advised, however, that sparring with Melana may make any other followers you have with you interpret this as her attacking you! Which can result in a real fight breaking out between your followers.

To avoid this, you may wish to make other followers wait in one location, while you take Melana somewhere else to spar with her.

Alternately, the sparring is not actually required to make her progress; she will also pick up experience just by following you into combat. This will, however, be slower than training her directly.

Also, note that while Melana is trainable, her focus is so far known to be on melee combat. So you shouldn't expect her to be useful for ranged or magical fighting.

## Project AHO followers

See [Mod overview: Project AHO](Mod-overview:-Project-AHO/) for info on its two followers.

## Ralya and Runs-With-Sticks

<details>
<summary>Overview of Ralya and Runs-With-Sticks...</summary>

These two followers are additional NPCs added to Cidhna Mine by the mod Tuxborn is running to expand that location and plot. You can recruit them for help in breaking out of the mine, which can be very useful if you don't want to side with Madanach. Neither of them are very complex; they appear to just use vanilla follower code. But they are perfectly acceptable if all you need out of them is to be additional fighters. Once you run Cidhna Mine, you might consider using them as stewards for the Hearthfire houses.
</details>

## Wyrmstooth followers

<details>
<summary>Overview of Wyrmstooth followers...</summary>
When you run the Wyrmstooth main plot, you will partner with a group of mercenaries: Athir, Daenlit, Elmera, and Shargam. Each of these characters has a favor quest you can run which will then let you recruit them as a follower after.

There is also a side quest you can run on the island which will result in your acquiring a wolf, Faelor, as an animal follower. She can be useful in combat, and will follow you back to Skyrim, although she will never enter any buildings.
</details>

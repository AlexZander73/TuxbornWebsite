This is the overview page for The Forgotten City, one of Tuxborn's DLC-sized quest mods!

## "What is The Forgotten City about?"

When you, the Dragonborn, are asked to help an adventurer find her missing brother, this will lead you to discovering a settlement cut off from the rest of Skyrim--and needing to take action to save it from complete destruction.

## "How do I start The Forgotten City?"

You will receive a letter by courier from someone named Cassia asking for your help. Reading that letter will kick off the mod, and you'll get an objective to meet Cassia at the entrance of the ruins she and her brother have been exploring.

Normally this would happen at level 5. But in our load order, the letter's arrival is delayed until you reach level 25.

## "What's a good level to start The Forgotten City?"

25 is the minimum requirement. We suggest 30+ depending on what Difficulty level you're playing at.

## "What followers can I bring to The Forgotten City?"

This mod's narrative expects you to run it alone. Several of our custom followers have AI that will allow them to port into the mod's playspace to catch up with you. And while this might be helpful in fights, it will be immersion breaking for the circumstances of the story.

So we recommend that if you are running one or more followers, either dismiss them from your service, or ask them to wait for you in an appropriate location. The circumstances of the mod start should provide you with an appropriate RP point where you can do this. Cassia will not accompany you into the main mod space, so you can ask your followers to wait with her.

## "Does The Forgotten City have any displayable LOTD artifacts?"

Yes, there are six of them. However, depending on how you play through the mod, you may not be able to acquire all of them. You can see the list of them on the [Forgotten City display](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonborn_Hall_(Classic_Skyrim)#The_Forgotten_City_Display) info on the LOTD wiki.

If you explicitly want to make sure you get all six listed artifacts, you'll need to follow the plot branch that will let you do this. The [Forget-Me-Not quest page](https://tes-mods.fandom.com/wiki/Forget-Me-Not) on the TES Mods wiki has info on what you'd need to do. (Obviously, that involves spoilers, so click that link with caution.)

## "What armor and weapons are available in The Forgotten City?"

There is a full set of armor that is highly relevant to the plot, and which also makes up four of the six displayable LOTD artifacts. LOTD's wiki doesn't specify if these armor piece have replica recipes. So be sure to doublecheck at your replica station before deciding if you want to use or display the armor set.

## "Does The Forgotten City have any player homes?"

You will be given living quarters for the duration of the plot, but they are very basic. And you will not need to return to the mod's worldspace once you're done with the plot, so it has no need for a full player home.

## "Does The Forgotten City include any new followers?"

No.

## "What other custom content is available in The Forgotten City?"

It does not include any new Shouts, spells, potions, etc.

## "What side quests are available in The Forgotten City?"

There are several, which you can get from the various residents in the settlement where the story is set. Take the time to do them, as it will be appropriate for you to do so due to the circumstances of the plot.

## "What are some other recommendations for running The Forgotten City?"

When you come out of your initial visit to the citadel and are approached by a terrified Miranda about looters breaking into the city and putting everyone at risk, you may find it difficult to play through that part:

<summary>‼️ <i>Spoiler on what to do when the looters show up...</i> ‼️</summary>
<br>

***

Do not, repeat, DO NOT engage the looters in the open. Doing so will invoke the Dwarves' Law.

However, once you talk to Miranda, if you look to your immediate left, there should be a door leading into the shaft the looters are using to come down into the city. You can safely engage the looters there without activating the Dwarves' Law and destroying the town.

The part where you have to get the Immaculate Dwarven Gauntlets requires a lot of jumping. If this is not something you're good at in Skyrim, take your time with this part. A good light source should help you better determine where to jump. You may also want to adjust the settings in the INI file for Contextual Crosshair so that your crosshair will appear, at least if you have your hands up, so that you can better target which direction you're jumping in.

While it is possible to play through the ending of the plot without getting all four pieces of the Immaculate Dwarven Armor, it is not recommended, especially if you want them for museum display. But there's a big problem with that:

<details>
<summary>‼️ <i>Huge spoiler re: getting all four pieces of the Immaculate Dwarven Armor...</i> ‼️</summary>
<br>

***

You will not be able to acquire all four pieces of this armor without either pickpocketing the cuirass off of Rykas, or outright killing him. He will flat out refuse to sell it to you, and you have no other options besides theft or murder. And yes, this _will_ mean deliberately invoking the Dwarves' Law.

If you're playing a thief, and you've leveled your Security skill high enough to unlock the Perfect Touch perk that lets you pickpocket equipped items, you can go that route. Otherwise, you're going to have to kill him.

Consider reporting him to Jarl Matellus as your likely suspect, for an RP reason to go after him.

If you want to try playing through the ending of this mod _without_ getting all four pieces of the armor (and therefore avoiding the choices you have to make in the above second spoiler), then you should have a high enough Magicka pool and a high enough skill in Restoration to constantly heal yourself. Heavily enchanted gear that can boost your Health Regeneration may help in this regard.

Last but not least, as noted above, don't come into this mod with your followers. Some followers may auto-port in with you, and you could absolutely summon certain followers to you. But the circumstances of the story are such that the plot _will break_ if you have followers with you. Not in a way that prevents finishing the mod, but more a question of breaking immersion:

***

The Immaculate Dwarven Armor is essentially meant to protect you from radiation, although that term is not used by the mod. It's a huge plot point that you need to get the complete set to keep the "strange energy" from killing you as you proceed down to the final climax of the story.

And if you have followers with you, _they are not impacted by that in the slightest_. There's no extra armor to give them, even though the "strange energy" should absolutely affect them too.

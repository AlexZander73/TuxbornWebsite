## Anniversary Edition alternative armor sets

Since Tuxborn has the Anniversary Edition as a hard requirement, this will mean by extension that a Tuxborn install will have all the extra armor sets from the Anniversary Edition available to the player.

A few important notes about this gear:

One: Tuxborn is running the Rebalancing Anniversary Edition mod, which changes a lot of the requirements for the various AE content, including the armors. Its requirements are configurable in its MCM. So if you want any particular armor set from the AE, and you can't get to it when you think you should be, the RAE mod will be why. Consult its MCM to see what its default settings are, and adjust any of them that you don't like.

Two: a bunch of the AE armor sets are all tied together in a loose assortment of quests surrounding a group of bandits called the Crimson Dirks. We are also running a mod that impacts this, called On a Crimson Trail, which does some changes to how all those quests work to tie them together more coherently.

The armor sets associated with the Crimson Dirks quests will come in two forms: the enchanted versions that are quest rewards, and non-enchanted ones that you can craft yourself. Note that the non-enchanted versions of this armor _will_ be displayable in the LOTD museum. So even if you don't want to wear those armor sets yourself, it's worth making at least one set of each one, just to add to your museum.

Three: We are running various patches that do retextures of all these armor sets. So while they will still look familiar to players who know the AE, expect there to be differences in coloration and such.

For more information on the Alternative Armor sets, if you're not already familiar with them, look at the [Creation Club](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Creation_Club) page on the UESP, and scroll down that page for any of the Creations with "Alternative Armor" in their titles.

For more information on the Rebalancing Anniversary Edition mod, consult [its mod page on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61004). For more information on On a Crimson Trail, have a look at [its Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52647).

## Anniversary Edition weapons

Like Legacy of the Dragonborn, the Anniversary Edition made a strong effort to bring artifacts from earlier Elder Scrolls games into Skyrim. But since the Tuxborn load order does contain Legacy of the Dragonborn, in some places there will be conflicts between how the AE handles them, and how LOTD does. In general these conflicts should be patched by our load order, but they do mean that how you get various weapons may differ from what you're used to, if you're only familiar with the AE. And in some cases, the weapon you get off of an AE quest may be replaced by a weapon with a different name.

For example, the AE quest to get the Bow of Shadows will actually give you a weapon called the Bow of Obfuscation instead, since LOTD has its own requirements for getting the Bow of Shadows, and LOTD's requirements take precedence in our patches.

Several named weapons available in the AE as part of the Ghosts of Tribunal plot, such as Hopesfire and Trueflame, will still be available in our load order even though we're running [Ghosts of the Tribunal - Reduced Cut](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67019). We're running the version of the mod that allows for keeping the quest. Still, it's possible that its expectations for how you get those items may collide with LOTD's expectations. We'll document specific pointers for weapons of interest here, as we review them.

## Carved Brink armor and weapons

More info on this can be found on the [Mod overview: Carved Brink](Mod-overview:-Carved-Brink/) page.

## Crossbows

There are different types of crossbow available in Tuxborn's load order. Most of these are content available as part of the AE, but we're covering them on this page anyway as they are impacted by the Thwack mod we're running.

* The Steel and Dwarven ones available via Sorine Jurard's side quests in Dawnguard 
* Ebony and Elven ones available via the Anniversary Edition quest "Night Hunter", from the "Elite Crossbows" Creation
* Eight additional types (with normal and enhanced versions) available via the AE "Expanded Crossbow Pack" Creation
* A custom crossbow available from Remiel if you run her as a follower

We are running a mod called [Thwack - Crossbow Collection Reworked](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42653), which overhauls the Elite Crossbows creation and makes the "Night Hunter" quest tie in to Sorine's side quests in Dawnguard. It makes Sorine's last quest send you to Ironback Hideout, and there, you'll then be able to launch "Night Hunter". Look for Kragash's Letter there to kick off that quest.

So doing this quest sequence will get you the ability to make Steel, Dwarven, Ebony, and Elven crossbows. You will still need all the relevant Smithing perks to do so.

For the crossbow types added by the Expanded Crossbow Pack Creation, you should be able to make any of those at a forge, though you will need to have the relevant perks on your Smithing skill tree. You should also be able to buy those crossbow types from Fletcher in Solitude. If you buy any of the normal variants of those crossbows, or make one at a forge, you should also be able to use that bow to craft an enhanced one.

You will need to run the quest "A New Source of Stalhrim" on Solstheim if you want to be able to make stalhrim crossbows.

Lastly, if you want Remiel to make her crossbow for you, you'll need to run her side quest to do that. It's launched off a dialogue option with Remiel, so be sure and take any interesting dialogue options you have with her. More details on this are on the [Remiel FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUNNalaj6alRwRiY9shqu8AE-NBmNLIR/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.p0n7xkrlutjs) that Remiel's creator has available as a Google Doc. Remiel's crossbow is a particularly effective one, so if you're a crossbow fan, and you want to run Remiel, getting her to make that weapon for you is definitely useful.

### Perks required to make the various crossbow types

Since we're running the Adamant mod which overhauls perks, here's a table of which perks you should have active to make the various crossbow types:

| Crossbow type | Required perk | Required quest | Required forge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Steel | Basic Smithing | Ask Sorine Jurard in Dawnguard how to make a crossbow | Any |
| Dwarven | Journeyman Smithing | Sorine's Ancient Technology side quests | Gunmar's forge or Safehouse forge |
| Elven | Rare Smithing | Night Hunter | Any |
| Ebony | Advanced Smithing | Night Hunter | Any |
| Daedric | Mythic Smithing | Craftable at a forge | Any |
| Dragonbone | Mythic Smithing | Craftable at a forge | Any |
| Glass | Exotic Smithing | Craftable at a forge | Any |
| Imperial | Basic Smithing | Craftable at a forge | Any |
| Nordic | Intermediate Smithing | Craftable at a forge | Any |
| Orcish | Intermediate Smithing | Craftable at a forge | Any |
| Silver | Journeyman Smithing (?) | Craftable at a forge | Any |
| Stalhrim | Advanced Smithing | A New Source of Stalhrim | Any |

### Crossbow ammo

There are a number of options for crossbolt bolts, as follows:

* Steel and Dwarven bolts: Normal ones you should be able to make if you ask Sorine Jurard how to make a basic crossbow. You should then also be able to buy the bolts from Sorine, or at the Drunken Huntsman or Fletcher.
* Exploding Steel and Dwarven bolts: Available once you run Sorine's quests. Craftable at Gunmar's forge in Fort Dawnguard, or at the Safehouse if you're running LOTD. Some will also be available when you run the "Night Hunter" quest.
* Rare Curios crossbow bolts: Includes Bonemold, Corkbulb, Iron, Orcish, and Silver bolts. Some can be purchased, others can be crafted. Details on the [Rare Curios Items](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rare_Curios_Items) page on the UESP.
* Clockwork Shots: Requires running Wheels of Lull. Purchasable from Avarri, or craftable if you get the Clockwork Shot Mold. These are primarily intended for the harquebuses in the mod, but will also work with crossbows. More info on the [Mod overview: Wheels of Lull](Mod-overview:-Wheels-of-Lull/) page.
* Ammo for Remiel's Crossbow: Requires running Remiel's side quest to make her crossbow. She'll give you a number of bolts to go with it, as well.

## Demon Slayer armor and weapons

When you first start your character and reach a forge, you may notice that "Demon Slayer" items show up as things you are not able to make. You may also see the Last Whisper arrows referenced, or the Silver Fang sword.

All of this gear is part of the Demon Slayer gear mod. There is no quest that directs you to go find this gear if you want it. You will simply need to find the dungeon that contains the gear. Once you get there, though, there will be a decent little backstory and local quest to run.

It's a crunchy dungeon, with a lot of draugr mobs, so it may be challenging for low level characters. Prepare accordingly. Strong gear or a good follower squad are recommended.

The dungeon is called Heroes Rest Crypt. It's down in the southeastern corner of the map, in the vicinity of Stendarr's Beacon and the entrance into Dayspring Canyon to get to Fort Dawnguard. So queuing that up as an objective to run in parallel with starting Dawnguard, or perhaps finding the follower Xelzaz, is possibly a good plan.

Note also that the armor is designed for female characters by default, but if you're playing a male Dragonborn, you can adjust the pieces over to their male equivalents once you're at a forge. This is _why_ these items show up on the forge. Also, both the female and male versions have a few different variations on each piece, so take the time to experiment with the forge options so you can see which ones you like the best.

The Demon Slayer armor is heavy armor, but it's some of the nicest designed heavy armor I've ever personally seen in Skyrim. So if you normally avoid heavy armor because it looks clunky, give this gear a look.

Likewise, the Silver Fang sword is a two-hander by default, but if you prefer one-handed swords, you can also convert Silver Fang at a forge.

The arrows for Last Whisper are craftable. And the recipe for this is also craftable. Look for it on a tanning rack.

This gear is silver-based and accordingly does extra damage to undead. So it's a really good option to consider as alternate gear to wear while running Dawnguard, if the Dawnguard gear is not to your tastes.

More info on this gear set can be found on [its page on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97731).

## Elmlock armor and blade

The Elmlock gear is a craftable set, available to make at any forge as soon as you unlock Ebony smithing. Unlike standard vanilla Skyrim Ebony armor, the Elmlock set is actually _light_ armor, not heavy.

Which is why it's also important to note that if you want to make the armor, you actually need to look under "Stalhrim" on your forge menu, not under "Ebony"! _This is not actually a bug_, it is intended behavior from the mod. As per the mod's creators, the reason they did this is because they wanted to make a light armor set that still has Ebony-like stats, and the only way they were able to do this was to classify it as "Stalhrim" in the forge UI.

This also means that if you try to deconstruct any piece of Elmlock armor at a smelter, you will get back stalhrim, not ebony. And since you are able to make this gear as soon as you have Ebony smithing unlocked, this is a sneaky backdoor way to build up a stock of stalhrim if you feel the need.

However, this ebony vs. stalhrim discrepancy does _not_ apply to the associated weapon. The Elmlock blade is a greatsword, and you will find it available under "Ebony" as expected at the forge. If you are normally not a fan of greatswords, the Elmlock blade might still appeal to you as it has a faster swing speed than a standard Ebony greatsword.

Also, once you've got a set of the standard Elmlock gear in your inventory, you will also see additional options to create color variants of it on your forge, as long as you have sufficient mats.

For more information on the gear, have a look at its [mod page on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105930). To see what the color variants look like, have a look at [the patch we're running](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107603) that adds those additional colors.

The Elmlock gear in general is a strong gear set to consider for Dragonborns who favor light armor. And for female Dragonborns in particular, it's a strong set for those who prefer less skimpy armor options.

## Immersive Armors sets

Tuxborn includes Immersive Armors in our load order, so all armor sets available in that mod should be available in Tuxborn. Generally, look for these additional options to make at any forge. Or, you will likely see them showing up worn by NPCs, or sold by merchants.

We are also running various patches that retexture these armor sets, so they won't look quite the same as the original mod renders them. Expect improved detail and coloration.

## Legacy of the Dragonborn armor and weapons

LOTD is such a huge mod that it's impossible to list all of the various weapons and armor sets it makes available to the player. Suffice to say that LOTD adds a _lot_ of weapons, several of which overlap with artifacts in the AE, but many of which do _not_. Players familiar with earlier Elder Scrolls games, particularly Morrowind or Oblivion, may well recognize a lot of the artifact weapons LOTD adds to Skyrim.

Take a stroll around the Hall of Heroes in your museum, and you can get an idea of the various weapons and armor you can display there. Anything you want to learn more about, you can look up on the [Legacy of the Dragonborn wiki](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Dragonborn_Wiki).

In terms of armor, there are two armor sets you can craft fairly early on in your game, and which are faction armor for your Explorer's Society. This armor comes in a light and a heavy version, and each set involves only a chest piece, gloves, and boots; there is no associated helmet. Also, you can buy pieces of this armor from Eriana, once you have recruited her to the guild, if you don't want to make them yourself. Note these this armor is also displayable, so you'll want to get at least one set of each to display, even if you don't use it.

You can also acquire the same armor worn by the museum guards, if you happen to want it. There are pieces of it shelved in the Hall of Heroes office, and you can also buy them from Eriana.

Later in the LOTD plotline, at the end of the Shattered Legacy quest, you will be able to acquire and/or craft important gear pieces in the Visage of the Dragonborn set for armor, or the Ancient Tongues set for weapons. I won't go into detail on how you get to that point here, and for now will simply say, two words: Dragonsoul Forge.

## Moonpath to Elsweyr armor

There is a set of armor called Ancient Siligonder available via Moonpath to Elsweyr. This stuff is technically craftable at a forge before you run Moonpath--but you won't have access to the necessary materials for it until you do. There's a side quest in Moonpath you can run to acquire a set of this armor, and at the same time, you can pick up enough extra materials to make more copies of it later if you want to.

It's potentially useful as an early game armor set, just because it gives you a significant buff to your carry weight. But even if you don't care to wear it, it's displayable in the LOTD museum.

## Practical Female Armor sets

Tuxborn includes all available mods in the Practical Female Armor series of mods. These all basically tweak the look of armor sets in the vanilla content, making corrections that let these armor sets be more realistic in terms of providing protection to female warriors. By extension, this will generally mean a bunch of the vanilla armor will be less skimpy. In the case of heavy armor, it also de-emphasizes the chest area.

So if you lean towards playing female Dragonborns, and the LOOKIT MY CHEST ISN'T IT OBVIOUS NOW I AM PLAYING A GIRL style of vanilla armors doesn't appeal to you, all of these mods make it worth your time to take another look at the various vanilla armor options.

## Project AHO armor and weapons

When you run Project AHO, as part of that mod's plot, you can get a side quest that will let you learn how to craft a Telvanni Bow, as long as you have the Elven smithing perk. (Or in the case of Tuxborn's load order, the equivalent perk that unlocks Elven smithing.)

There are two tiers to this weapon, the regular one, and the Aetherium Telvanni Bow. Both of them are craftable with the appropriate materials, and the Aetherium one is the superior of the two. Both have better stats than other common bows you can find early on in the game, so they're worth crafting at least until you get better end-game bows. Also, the Aetherium version of this bow is a displayable LOTD museum artifact.

You will also be able to acquire Ancient Dwarven Swords and Ancient Dwarven Greatswords as part of loot drops during the latter stages of the mod. These are not craftable, but they have better stats than standard Dwarven weapons. So you might consider them if you favor swords.

Lastly, Telvanni Hybrid Armor and Boots are available as displayable museum artifacts, if you don't want to wear them. They are similar in style to Telvanni robes, only more armor-like. These can be found on board the AHO once you acquire it. Note that there is also a non-displayable Telvanni Hybrid Armor piece inside Hla Fang if you acquire that house, but Hla Fang does _not_ include an extra pair of the boots.

## Seasoned Traveller armor

This is another craftable set of gear, and it's perhaps the strongest craftable gear available early in the game. It includes:

* A hood
* A chest piece that you can make in a few different colors
* Gloves
* Boots
* A backpack you can make in the same colors available for the chest piece
* Swords in one-handed and two-handed varieties
* A pickaxe
* A walking stick

The backpacks in this gear set give +100 to carry weight, so they're better than the craftable AE backpacks. Definitely worth it to make yourself one of those, even before making any of the rest of the gear.

The hood allows for wearing circlets underneath it, but also still counts as light armor, so you can improve it at a forge if you wish.

The pickaxe doesn't behave differently than a vanilla pickaxe, it just looks different. But if you haven't already gotten a pickaxe and want one, it's an option to consider just to vary things up a bit from the standard pickaxe.

The walking stick will give you a small bump to your Stamina. You could also use it to block damage like you would with a shield, if you equip it in your left hand.

You will need to stock up on corundum to make items in this set. Go hunting for corundum veins, or spend some coin to buy ingots from your favorite blacksmith.

You can see what the gear looks like on [its page on Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70222).

## Traveler's Armor Pack

The [Traveler's Armor gear](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93138) is a craftable set good to consider early in the game. Its main selling point is that it's visually upgradable, with additional refinements you can make to the pieces as you advance in your smithing. It is light armor, and slightly less powerful than the Seasoned Traveler gear. So you might want to consider stats vs. appearance on these two sets, to determine which better suits your playstyle and tastes.

You can see what the gear looks like in its various stages on the Nexus link provided. To make an initial set of it, as well as do some early upgrades, you'll want to stock up on Tundra Cotton.

## The Wheels of Lull armor and weapons

The Wheels of Lull is one of the two mods in the Tuxborn load order that allows the player to acquire firearms. In the case of The Wheels of Lull, this means six different varieties of harquebus (a type of rifle that was a precursor to the musket IRL). Additionally, The Wheels of Lull has a custom light armor set, and a few other unique armor items as well.

See the [Mod overview: Wheels of Lull](Mod-overview:-Wheels-of-Lull/) page for further details.

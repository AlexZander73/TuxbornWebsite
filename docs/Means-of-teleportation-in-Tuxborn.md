This page covers an assortment of ways provided by the Tuxborn load order that you can use to teleport yourself. These may be of interest for players in any of the following situations:

1. You want to do a no-fast-travel playthrough
2. You're in a bad combat situation and need an immediate escape
3. You're physically stuck somewhere and can't jump out
4. You've run into the issue on Wyrmstooth where the fast travel marker back to Skyrim isn't visible unless you use the console to move yourself to where it is (see the [Mod overview: Wyrmstooth](Mod-overview:-Wyrmstooth/) page for more details)

## Spells

### Apocalypse spells

#### Milestones

Milestones is a Master-level Alteration spell. It allows you to set up to five teleportation anchors and transport freely between them.

Note that this spell is limited to only five anchors, so if you decide to use it, choose where to put your anchors wisely.

### Mysticism spells

#### Mark and Recall

These two spells are Expert-level Conjuration spells that work in tandem with each other, similar to how Mark and Recall worked in Morrowind. Use the Mark spell to mark a location, and the Recall spell to return to that location later.

#### Shalidor's Beacon

This is an Expert-level Conjuration spell which will send you back to the College of Winterhold.

### Pilgrim spells

Pilgrim adds a number of "Divine Intervention" type spells which can teleport you to their associated temples. Most of these can be purchased from the priest vendors added to the game in various cities.

You can also find a spellbook of Pilgrim's Intervention while running the Forgotten Vale in Dawnguard, which will teleport you to the Falmer shrine within the Vale.

## Legacy of the Dragonborn options

### Delrune's Dwemer Compass

[Delrune's Dwemer Compass](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Delrune's_Dwemer_Compass) is a thing you can craft once you've met its requirements.

Note that one of the items you'll need to make the thing is only available once you make it into Blackreach, so this is a thing you'll probably only be able to make once you're in the middle stretches of your game.

The Compass will allow you to set up to three known locations, and port to them as long as you're already outside.

### The Tonal Staff of Karagas

[The Tonal Staff of Karagas](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/The_Tonal_Staff_of_Karagas) is a reward object you'll get once you finish the excavation of Rkund in LOTD. It's the means to acquire a teleport spell that can send you back to Karagas' Tower if you need to get there for whatever reason.

### Safehouse Teleporter

If you buy the appropriate receipt from Bits and Pieces in Solitude, you can set up one of the rooms in the Safehouse as a [teleportation chamber](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Safehouse_Teleporter) that will give you pads that'll send you off to any of the nine major locations in Skyrim.

## Options from other mods

Teleporting options via other mods are generally only useful in regards to getting into or out of their player homes. However, if the player home in question has any means to let you get back to Skyrim vs. the last specific location you were in, you could still use any of these means to escape a bad combat situation, or a situation where you're stuck without any other means of travel.

### Clockwork

Once you finish Clockwork, you will be given a Recall spell that will send you back to that particular player home. And to return to Skyrim from there, you'll have a teleportation machine that can send you back to any of Skyrim's nine holds.

### Identity Crisis

This mod's player house has portals that go from it back to Skyrim, and a custom one to set to the location of your choosing.

### Krovaxis

This mod's player house does have a means of porting into and out of it, but it appears to be limited to the Halls of the Dead in Solitude and Riften.

### The Midden - Expanded

This mod provides an Arcane Recall spell that will let you return to its player home, the Arcane Grotto. It also has a teleportation station for getting back out again, but this only sends you back to the surface near the College, and cannot send you to any other specific location. Also, that teleporter will only work if you have Drelas' Key in your inventory.

### Tsatampra Xiros 

This mod has a spell that will let you port to the Annals and back.

### Wheels of Lull

The side quest "Water Under the Bridge" in Wheels of Lull, if you play it in favor of Subori, will give a Lull-Mor Teleporter object which will let you teleport immediately to the main square of Lull-Mor, even if you're inside.

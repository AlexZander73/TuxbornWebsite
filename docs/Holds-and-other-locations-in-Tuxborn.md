This page is an overview of the nine holds in Skyrim, and locations that are considered part of those holds. A lot of this info is available on the UESP. But we're covering it here as a quick and easy reference for benefit of Tuxborn players, since the maps we use in our load order don't make it clear where the boundaries between holds are. And the carriage driver mods we're using list the holds first in dialogue with the player, requiring you to drill down into each hold to find the location you want.

Locations listed in this table will include not only places the carriage drivers can take you to, but also locations that are relevant to base game side quests and to mods in our load order.

## "What is this mod about?"

Konahrik's Accoutrements offers a lot more detail to your combat encounters with the named dragon priests. It adds additional gear for them, and a new location to visit once you've acquired all of the masks, including Konahrik, from [Bromjunaar Sanctuary](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bromjunaar_Sanctuary) in Labyrinthian.

## "How do I start Konahrik's Accoutrements?"

There's no overall quest for this, per se. Just start killing dragon priests when you're ready. You will need to take out the standard eight vanilla dragon priests, as they are the ones required to proceed to Bromjunaar Sanctuary. Consult the [Dragon Priest](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Priest) page on the UESP for the full list.

You should encounter Morokei as part of running the College of Winterhold plot. The rest of them you'll need to seek out as side adventures, though you may get miscellaneous quests to visit their locations, either via the Letter From a Friend courier note, or from asking Arngeir at High Hrothgar for additional Shout locations.

## "What do I do at Bromjunaar Sanctuary?"

Bromjunaar is a vanilla location, so try going there once you acquire the eight dragon priest masks. The mod will most likely have additional things for you to do once you're there.

Note that the dragon priest masks _are_ all displayable items in Legacy of the Dragonborn. So if you happened to put them on display in your museum, you may need to go back and get them before going to Bromjunaar.

## "What do I need to do to go to Revakheim?"

This is the additional dungeon added by the mod. We don't recommend trying to go there until you've completed Bromjunaar Sanctuary. We'll add more on what to do once that's confirmed.

## "What do I do with the cursed items I get off of dragon priests?"

They need to have their curses removed. Once you do that, they _will_ be displayable items for Legacy of the Dragonborn. _Or_, if you so wish, you can use them. 

### Make some Scrolls of Abjuration

First thing you need to do is make sure you have some Scrolls of Abjuration. These require two ingredients: Dragon Priest Ashes and Dragonhide. The ashes should drop off of any dragon priest you kill. Dragonhide can be crafted at a tanning rack, using dragon scales.

The scrolls can also be made at tanning racks.

### Removing the curse off of dragon priest items

When you kill any of the named dragon priests in the game, in addition to their usual masks, they should also drop gloves, greaves, and robes. All three of these items will be cursed. But you can use the Scrolls of Abjuration to fix that problem.

A recommended way to do this is to just drop all three cursed items somewhere near you, in a close pile. Then wield a Scroll of Abjuration in either hand. Use the wielded scroll and hit all three items. One scroll should be adequate to clear the curse on all three, you should _not_ need to use three scrolls to do this.

The gloves, greaves, and robes should all now be displayable, or usable if you wish.

They are _not_ known to have replica recipes, but Konahrik's Accoutrements apparently has a means of getting additional cursed items associated with dragon priests you've already killed if you want them, once you go to Revakheim. So plan accordingly.

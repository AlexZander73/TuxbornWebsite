## "Why can't I find or craft potions or create enchantments to fortify Blacksmithing, Alchemy, or Enchanting?"

These are removed by the Simonrim mods we're running.

## "Carved Brink has powders that are named like they're supposed to fortify crafting, but they don't, why is that?"

Simonrim changed the abilities of the Carved Brink powders, but only indirectly, because their abilities _are_ vanilla. But their names were _not_ changed, because that would have required a direct patch. So just note that any powders from Carved Brink, even if their names suggest otherwise, will not be able to fortify your crafting skills either.

## "The Aetherial Amulet in Tools of Kagrenac says it's supposed to give me a Smithing buff, but it's not doing that, why is that?"

Same reason as with the powders: Simonrim. The Amulet most likely normally has the vanilla Fortify Smithing enchantment, which has been removed by the mod Thaumaturgy. So in our load order, the Amulet will fortify your Armor Rating instead.

## "Does this mean I can't improve my gear up to Legendary?"

It does not mean that. You should still be able to reasonably improve all your gear as long as you unlock all relevant perks in Smithing and Enchanting. You may not be able to do multiple iterations of Legendary as you would in vanilla, but Legendary in general, yes.

## "But I really like crafting! Are there _any_ ways to fortify my skill at that?"

The following are known means you can still use to fortify your crafting skills.

None of the known vanilla means for boosting your crafting skills are known to work in our load order. This is due to changes from the Simonrim mods Thaumaturgy (which impacts Enchanting), Apothecary (which impacts Alchemy), Adamant (which impacts perks), and Artificer (which impacts unique artifacts).

However, some of our mods are _not_ impacted by the Simonrim mods, because the methods they're using to fortify abilities are not based on vanilla potions or enchantments. Thus, they aren't impacted by Simonrim, and still provide ways you can fortify your crafting.

### Mannaz method

If you decide to play an Altmer, you will get a racial bonus that will make all enchantments 15% more effective for you. This includes enchantments on things you find as loot, things you buy, or things you craft!

### Legacy of the Dragonborn methods

The methods you can use via Legacy of the Dragonborn include:

* [The Deck of Builders](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Deck_of_Builders), which will give you +10 to Smithing, Alchemy, and Enchanting. This is not a huge buff, but it may be enough to bump you up another tier in ability, if you're borderline. And it may even get you a second level of Legendary-level improvement on your gear.
* The dragon priest mask [Vahlok](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Vahlok) still works to buff your enchanting. As per the LOTD wiki, it buffs it by 20%. Vahlok is _not_ a vanilla dragon priest mask, it's added in by LOTD.
* [Ice's Stalhrim Spoon of Assassination](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Ice%27s_Stalhrim_Spoon_of_Assassination_(SSE)), which is a special easter egg in the LOTD museum honoring LOTD's creator. It gives +5 to crafting skills while in your inventory. LOTD's wiki does _not_ say how to find it, and this is on purpose.

The spoon is hidden within the museum proper. Look all over the place for raised stones! Triggering those stones in the correct sequence will open up where the spoon is hidden.

Last but not least, finishing the quest Shattered Legacy will get you a full get of gear with significant buffs to your enchanting:

<p>If you finish the quest Shattered Legacy, you will get access to a set of gear called Visage of the Dragonborn. And if you have every single piece of this gear equipped, including the Sword of Ancient Tongues which Auryen will give you when you have 550 displays in your museum, you will get the following very tasty bonuses to enchanting:</p>

* Increases magnitude of enchantments by 40%
* Increases charge of enchantments by 40%
* Increases recharge amount of enchantments by 40%
* All items can be enchanted with one extra effect

### Wheel of Time mod method

The Wheel of Time crossover mod we're running includes a spell called Aligning the Matrix. This is an Alteration spell which will temporarily boost your Smithing and Enchanting by 20%.
 
## "Why are there two different Imp Gall alchemy ingredients?"

One of them is [the one from the Anniversary Edition](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Imp_Gall). The other one is from [Imps and Homonculus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101380). They have two different assets when viewed in your inventory, and if you happen to have both of them, the AE one is the one that will appear first. Visually, you can also tell them apart by how the graphic for the AE Imp Gall is more yellow, and the Imps and Homonculus Imp Gall is more red.

Their properties are almost but _not entirely_ identical. Both will work for potions of Fortify Magicka Regeneration, Damage Health, or Fortify Barter.

However, only the AE version of Imp Gall will work to create a potion of Muffle. The fourth potion type that the Imps and Homonculus version of the ingredient can create is so far unknown, but we will update this page when we identify it.

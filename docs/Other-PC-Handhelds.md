Most PC Handheld have specs close or better then the Steam Deck, so they should just be able to run the list using the Deck or Handheld profile without any issue. With the major expectation of the resolution, sind a lot of the use 1080p or above. Under optional there is a mod named _Lower Render Resolution_ that will help with that, while still scaling to the screen. Within that mod you can also set a lower resolution if you want to, but lowering the resolution scale is recommended over that. In addition you need to make sure that the system is running at the correct wattage, how you can set that will depend on what handheld you have and is best googled. For most chips, including the AMD z family of chips, it's recommended you use 15w or higher. This should net you similar or better framerate then on the Deck, but we don’t have the hardware itself so feel free to tell use your experience.

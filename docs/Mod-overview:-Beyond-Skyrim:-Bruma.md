This page is the overview for Beyond Skyrim: Bruma as included in Tuxborn.

## "What is this mod about?"

Beyond Skyrim: Bruma is a working proof of concept for the eventual release of Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil, one of the major projects in progress from the folks at [Beyond Skyrim](https://beyondskyrim.org). It is essentially implementing a portion of the Jerall Mountains region in Cyrodiil, including the city of Bruma, and some of the surrounding countryside.

Bruma has one known main quest, which will center around you helping the captain of the Bruma guard with various challenges that impact the city. There are a few side quests you can run as well.

It is one of the few mods covered on the UESP, so you can find more info about it on [its UESP page](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Beyond_Skyrim:Bruma). There is [a page for it](https://tes-mods.fandom.com/wiki/Beyond_Skyrim_-_Bruma) as well on the TES Mods wiki.

## "How do I start Beyond Skyrim: Bruma?"

Bruma has no auto-start and no level requirement, so if you want to play it, you'll just need to go to Cyrodiil and start looking for stuff to do.

The access point to Cyrodiil is down at the very bottom edge of the map, south-ish of Helgen. The nearest base game landmark will be Southfringe Sanctum, and some additional nearby landmarks from our mods will include the Thalmor Prison and Englemann's Rest. You'll specifically want to look for the gate at Pale Pass.

If you want to enter Cyrodiil in the above-board fashion, you'll need to persuade your way past the guard at the gate. If you want to go in more surreptitiously, not far away there should be an NPC you can bribe for information about the Serpent's Trail. Note: if you go that route, there will be a _lot_ of smugglers you'll have to fight your way past in there.

Once you're in Cyrodiil, just about all of the available quests will launch by your talking to various NPCs. So make your way to the city, and talk to any interesting-looking NPCs on the way.

When you reach the city, you'll want to look for Adius Villius, the captain of the guard. He'll be the primary means of your playing through Bruma's quest.

## "What's a good level to start Beyond Skyrim: Bruma?"

Bruma does not have any level requirement, and its content should level appropriately with you. So basically, go down there whenever you feel it is appropriate for your Dragonborn to do so.

## "What followers are best to bring to Beyond Skyrim: Bruma?"

Lucien has a considerable amount of commentary about Bruma, not surprisingly, given that he _is_ an Imperial scholar. Lydia likewise is reported to have considerable Bruma-specific commentary. So they are currently our recommended options for followers to take to Bruma.

Of our custom followers, so far they are the only ones confirmed to have Bruma-related commentary. We'll update this page appropriately if we confirm otherwise.

Aside from Lucien, bring whoever you like. None of the content in Bruma should block any particular followers from coming with you.

## "What should I bring to run Beyond Skyrim: Bruma?"

Whatever you consider to be appropriate gear for your Dragonborn. The types of content you can expect to run will include:

* Interactions within Bruma itself
* Fighting bandits in surrounding caves or other bandit lairs
* Fighting hostile and sometimes large creatures in the surrounding countryside (think trolls, ogres, etc.)
* Fighting necromancers/conjurers in an Ayleid ruin

So bring whatever you feel is appropriate for those situations.

## "Does Beyond Skyrim: Bruma have any displayable LOTD artifacts?"

Yes, and our load order includes appropriate patches for LOTD compatibility! There is a large room for Bruma-related artifacts accessible off the Hall of Oddities.

You should be able to acquire quite a few of Bruma's relics simply by interacting with Khajiit traders, who will regularly sell them. This will include clothing items as well as typical clutter items such as dishes.

You'll also be able to make various Cyrodilic armor and weapons at any forge, so don't forget to make those just as an easy way to fill out your displays.

The patch to support Bruma is not officially supported LOTD content, but there _is_ [a page for it](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Unofficial_Beyond_Skyrim_-_Bruma_Synergy_Patch) on LOTD's wiki page. So review that to get an idea of the types of items you'll want to look for. Or, go visit the Hall of Oddities in your museum, and find the Bruma room.

## "What armor and weapons are available in Beyond Skyrima: Bruma?"


There are quite a few items available in the mod, although none of it is known to be competitive with higher-end gear available in the main Skyrim worldspace.

## "Does Beyond Skyrim: Bruma have any player homes?"

Yes. White Pine Lodge is the player home available in the worldspace for Beyond Skyrim - Bruma. You have to play all of the main Bruma plot before you get permission to buy the house. But once you get that permission, acquisition and furnishing is similar to Breezehome in Whiterun, in that you pay gold to the city steward for it.

The home's quite nice, but like a few other homes on this list, lacks a smelter. But there's a working forge in the city that does have a smelter, so YMMV on whether this is a dealbreaker for you for choosing a home base.

Being located in Bruma will possibly be the larger dealbreaker, as that is of course outside the main Skyrim worldspace, so it is not exactly conveniently located to anything else.

## "Does Beyond Skyrim: Bruma have any new followers?"

There are two NPCs who can become your follower after you finish the relevant quests for them. [Info on these NPCs](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Beyond_Skyrim:Cyrodiil/Services#Followers) can be found on the UESP.

## "What other custom content is available in Beyond Skyrim: Bruma?"

Bruma's unique content is called out pretty well on the UESP at the following links:

* [Items](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Beyond_Skyrim:Items): Master index for items in the mod
* [Alchemy ingredients](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Beyond_Skyrim:Ingredients)

‼️ **Note: Bruma ingredients, like ingredients from the base game, will be impacted by changes put into our load order by Apothecary. So while the UESP page on the Alchemy ingredients can be a starting  point, it won't be guaranteed to be completely accurate for our load order.**

## "What side quests are available in Beyond Skyrim: Bruma?"

There are a small number of them, again documented on the UESP, at the [Quests](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Beyond_Skyrim:Cyrodiil/Quests) page for Bruma.

## "What are some recommendations for running Beyond Skyrim: Bruma?"

If you need an RP excuse to go to Bruma, note also that Auryen in Legacy of the Dragonborn may send you down there with one of his random "find me a relic" fetch quests.

LOTD's Shattered Legacy quest will send you to Pale Pass, so you might take that as an opportunity to head into Bruma before or after. The access point LOTD uses to get you into Pale Pass is very near to the gate you'd use to enter Cyrodiil.

If you don't get a convenient "find me a relic" quest off of Auryen to go to Bruma, or you don't feel like taking advantage of Shattered Legacy's objective to send you to Pale Pass, then in general think a bit about what circumstances would feel appropriate to you for your Dragonborn to go to Cyrodiil. It could be appropriate to go there early, before you're aware of the bigger stakes for saving the world from Alduin. _Or_, you might not feel it appropriate to go to a whole other province while Skyrim is still in active danger. Whatever feels best for your playthrough.

Lastly, one big thing you should really keep in mind is that Beyond Skyrim: Bruma is _not_ a final product. It is the proof of concept for Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil. This is why Bruma may feel a bit rough around the edges to you.

And, in particular, there is one big thing about Bruma's main quest impacted by this. The quest can play out in different ways depending on what choices you make. But with almost all of these choices, an event can happen that you will _not_ be able to resolve. Bruma's dev team has confirmed in discussion on Reddit that this event _will_ eventually have a resolution once Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil is finally released.

But until that happens, do not be surprised if Bruma's plot does not give you proper narrative closure. We won't say more than that, because spoilers.

Lucien is yet another well-loved follower, a scholar from Cyrodiil very interested in learning more about Skyrim, and also passionate about Dwemer history. He is <i>very</i> reactive, with a wide array of commentary on content all over Skyrim.

## Where and when to recruit him

Lucien can be found in Dead Man's Drink, the inn in Falkreath. He won't force-greet you, but he may toss a line of dialogue your way if you pass close enough to him. If you strike up a conversation with him, he'll eventually ask if he can accompany you on your adventures.

## How to summon him

Lucien has no known way to summon him to you if you get separated from him, but he _does_ provide you with an item that will let you put a quest marker on him so you can find him.

## Best follower use

By default, Lucien has a bit of initial skill at magic. So he's a good choice to consider if you want a mage in your party. You can teach him additional spells if you get extra copies of the tomes, as well. (This is known to work for vanilla spell tomes, so far. We will update this page if it's also confirmed to work on other spell tomes available in our load order.)

However, he also has a detailed training system in general. So arguably, you can train him into whatever type of follower you actually need him to be. 

## Level of commentary to you

Lucien in general is one of the more talkative followers in our load order. So expect him to have a lot to say, both to you directly, and in response to current events in general.

It's generally a good idea to try to talk directly to Lucien on a regular basis. This will help boost his opinion of you, _and_ lead eventually to the triggering of his personal quest.

## Level of commentary about main quest, side quests, factions, and mods

His creator, Joseph Russell, documents what Lucien is set up to react to on <a href="https://josephrussellauthor.com/Lucien_Quests.php">this page on the Lucien site</a>.</p>

His ability to react to AE/CC stuff is not complete. But he _does_ react to a lot of AE content. We recommend taking him to run Forgotten Seasons, at Runoff Caverns, in particular. Don't forget to run the side quest to assemble the Dwarven Horse, if you want to see Lucien's mind blown.

But he's splendid to have with you in any Dwemer ruins, in geeral. And he'll geek out profusely when you acquire the Elder Scroll in Alftand.

Lucien is _not_ set up to respond to Dawnguard events, or to interact with Serana. This is notably different enough from his usual behavior that you might want to consider temporarily dismissing him while you run Dawnguard.

He is not set up to respond to Dragonborn events, either. However, he does have significant personal quest action on Solstheim. And he does have a few general Solstheim-related lines.

In terms of mod content, as per Joseph's page, Lucien's range there is somewhat limited. He reacts to:

* Beyond Skyrim - Bruma (not surprisingly, as he is an Imperial and a historian to boot)
* Moonpath to Elsweyr (also not surprisingly, as Joseph created the unofficial bugfix patch for Moonpath in Tuxborn's load order)
* Moon and Star

And that's it. Lucien does _not_ react to Legacy of the Dragonborn, unfortunately. Since the Dragonborn Gallery should in theory be very, very relevant to Lucien's interests, we'll all have to hope that his creator will eventually be able to deliver a Lucien update that'll let him do that!

## Level of commentary with other followers

Out of the other followers in our load order, Inigo is the one we recommend the most for pairing with Lucien. The two of them have extensive banter together, including making fun of "Ragnar the Red", commentary on each other's names, commentary on Inigo's passion for sweet rolls, and more.

Lucien is also known to have a small number of lines with Auri and Xelzaz.

He has a few exchanges with Lydia as well, but be advised that the patch we use to allow Lucien and Lydia to interact assumes her original voice actress. Our Lydia is modded, and revoiced, so expect any exchanges she has with Lucien to sound different than the rest of Lydia's lines!

## Some important notes

Lucien has no built-in way to ask him to live at any particular player home. However, he _will_ sandbox indefinitely if you ask him to wait somewhere, until you return to pick him up again.

Lucien is not actively hostile to either the Thieves Guild _or_ the Dark Brotherhood, and will voice no moral objections to your joining either faction. You will need to decide for yourself if Lucien is a good match for your Dragonborn, if you intend to join either group.

He has a general character arc he follows, starting off as a simple scholar until he eventually matures into a hero in his own right. You should hear this reflected in his voiced lines, as well as in the dialogue options you have with him.

If you're just getting started in your Tuxborn playthrough and want to know where you can find followers fast, consult the following tables. We've split these out into various major areas of the map, to help you figure out who's closest to wherever you happen to spawn after chargen!

## Dawnstar/The Pale

| Follower | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Tikrid | Interesting NPCs follower. If you take the Shipwrecked option in chargen, you may find Tikrid fairly fast by going to Snowpoint Beacon. You'll need to defeat the bandits there and talk to her afterwards, and agree to escort her to Dawnstar. |

## Falkreath/Falkreath Hold

| Follower | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Auri | Auri can be found at her pod, northwest-ish of Falkreath, not far from the Roadside Ruins. |
| Gore | You can pick up a quest marker to find Gore by talking to the innkeeper in Falkreath, or just go straight to Peak's Shade Tower. LOTD's quest Shadows of One's Past will give you a reason to go there as well. |
| Lucien | Lucien hangs out inside Dead Man's Drink. He will not force-greet you, although if you pass close enough to him, he'll give a line of dialogue asking to talk. |
| Melana | You will get a quest objective to go rescue Melana at Bannermist Tower the instant you set foot in Dead Man's Drink for the first time. |

## Markarth/The Reach

| Follower | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Ralya | Ralya is one of two followers you can recruit for backup in getting out of Cidhna Mine. |
| Remiel | Remiel should be near the front entrance of the Silver-Blood Inn. |
| Runs-With-Sticks | Runs-With-Sticks is the second of two followers you can recruit in Cidhna Mine as backup. |
| Vorstag | Vanilla mercenary at the Silver-Blood Inn, recruitable for 500 septims. |

## Raven Rock/Solstheim

| Follower | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Teldryn Sero | Vanilla mercenary at the Retching Netch, recruitable for 500 septims. Useful to consider if you take the "Left for dead" start up and spawn on Solstheim! |

## Riften/The Rift

| Follower | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Inigo | Inigo is in the Riften jail. You may find a letter he's left for you on the counter at the Bee and Barb, if you want a quest marker. |
| Marcurio | Mage mercenary at the Bee and Barb, recruitable for 500 septims. |
| Xelzaz | Xelzaz is down in the very bottom right corner of the map, not far from the entrance into Dayspring Canyon, at the gate into Morrowind on the edge of the map. A note you can use to get a specific quest marker should likewise be on the counter at the Bee and Barb, if you have trouble finding him. |

## Riverwood

| Follower | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Aviendha | The spawn point for Aviendha's portal is a short distance to the west of the Riverwood bridge, on the bank of the river opposite the town. |
| Faendal | Vanilla follower. Resolve the quest A Lovely Letter in his favor to recruit him as a follower. |
| Gorr | Can usually be found wandering around Riverwood, or hanging out at the Sleeping Giant Inn. |
| Sven | Resolve the quest A Lovely Letter in his favor. |

## Solitude/Haafingar

| Follower | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Belrand | Vanilla mercenary who can be hired at the Winking Skeever for 500 septims. |
| Katana | Katana can be found on the second floor of the Winking Skeever. She'll give you a dialogue line to get your attention if you pass close enough to her. |

## Whiterun/Whiterun Hold

| Follower | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Jenassa | Vanilla mercenary who can be recruited at the Drunken Huntsman for 500 septims. |
| Lydia | You'll get Lydia the same way in Tuxborn as you would in vanilla Skyrim, by becoming Thane of Whiterun. |
| Jesper | Jesper hangs out at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun, and can be very easily recruited. |
| Uthgerd the Unbroken | Vanilla follower. Beat Uthgerd in a brawl, and you can then recruit her as a follower. |
| Zora Fair-Child | She'll be in a cage inside Brittleshin Pass, not too far west of Whiterun. |

## Windhelm

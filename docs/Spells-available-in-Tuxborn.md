Tuxborn adds a high number of spells to the game, via various mods, as well as vendors from which you can buy a bunch of them. This page is to cover information about that.

#### ‼️ Additional note about the Darenii spells ‼️

You may notice "unaspected" perks in the Destruction skill tree. These are specifically meant to be used on the Darenii spells, which do not use either vanilla or Simonrim spell perks. If you want to play a Destruction mage, you may wish to read up on the specifics of how those perks work.

More information can be found about this on the [Ascension](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89223) page on Nexus. Ascension is a patch for Adamant also by Darenii, which hooks use of those perks into the Adamant skill tree design.

### Quest mods that add their own custom spells

The following quest mods include new spells in their available content:

* Beyond Reach
* Carved Brink - Adds a True Path spell useful for navigating through Faceted Stones while running this mod, but not useful outside of it
* Clockwork - Adds a recall spell you can use to return to Clockwork's player house from elsewhere in the world
* Demon Slayer Armor Mashup - Includes a number of powerful Conjuration spells to summon undead, as part of final boss loot
* Depths of the Reach - Adds a total of ten new spells
* Falskaar
* [Gravewind](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129582) - Adds several new spells, detailed on the mod's Nexus page
* Midwood Isle - Adds a total of nine new spells
* Project AHO - Adds five new spells that the player can pick up while running this mod
* Sleepwalking Into a Nightmare - Adds "Detect Sleeping" and "Encase in Nightmares" spells, with "Greater" and "Lesser" versions of the latter
* Wyrmstooth - Also adds several new spells

Of particular interest: both Project AHO and Wyrmstooth include Cure Disease spells, and these _can_ work to cure the Death's Grip debuff from Shades of Mortality. The two spells are _not_ identical; in theory, Project AHO's version can also cure diseases on allies as well as the player. Practically speaking, however, your followers are not likely to need this.

Project AHO also includes a Conjure Food spell, which may be of interest to players running Survival Mode.

Wyrmstooth includes an Ease Burden spell which can temporarily increase your carry weight, as well as a Night Eye spell that can let you see in the dark, similar to how a vampire or Khajiit would do.

### Follower mods that add spells

Several of our available custom followers use spells as means to configure them, or summon them to you if they get lost. Such spells are useful only in the context of dealing with those followers, and not for general game-wide use.

## Where to purchase spells

### Vanilla means of purchasing spells

Vanilla vendors should be able to sell you not only the known vanilla spells, but also spells from Apocalypse and Mysticism. These vendors include:

* All five trainers at the College of Winterhold:
    * Colette, for Restoration spells
    * Dravis, for Illusion spells
    * Faralda, for Destruction spells
    * Phinis, for Conjuration spells
    * Tolfdir, for Alteration spells
* Court wizards in various holds:
    * Calcelmo at Understone Keep in Markarth (sells Adept spells in Conjuration)
    * Farengar at Dragonsreach in Whiterun (sells Adept spells in Destruction)
    * Madena at the White Hall in Dawnstar (sells Adept spells in Destruction)
    * Sybille Stentor at the Blue Palace in Solitude (sells Adept spells in Illusion)
    * Wuunferth the Unliving at the Palace of the Kings in Windhelm (sells Adept spells in Destruction)
    * Wylandriah at Mistveil Keep in Riften (sells Adept spells in Alteration)
* General goods merchants:
    * Arnleif and Sons (Markarth): Random Novice spell tomes
    * Belethor's General Goods (Whiterun): Random Novice spell tomes
    * Bits and Pieces (Solitude): Random Novice spell tomes
    * Gray Pine Goods (Falkreath): Random Novice spell tomes
    * Pawned Prawn (Riften): Random Novice spell tomes
    * Sadri's Used Wares (Windhelm): Random Novice spell tomes
    * Riverwood Trader: Clairvoyance, Frostbite, Fury, Lesser Ward, Oakflesh, Raise Zombie

Additional notes:
1. Most, but not _all_, general good merchants will often have random Novice spells for sale as well, but this is mostly useful only in the early stages of a playthrough. It's worth checking the general good merchants, though, if you're in search of something basic like Candlelight or Oakflesh. See above list for which specific general goods merchants have spells.
2. The court mages and the College of Winterhold trainers have a wider variety of spells available thanks to Apocalypse and Mysticism. But the court mages have a less comprehensive assortment than the College of Winterhold trainers do. Court wizards will generally have a complete set of Novice and Apprentice spells, plus Adept spells in whatever school of magic they're proficient in (see names above for what schools they specialize in). The Adept spells however will be present in their lists _only_ if you're leveled up high enough in that specific skill. Also, not all schools of magic are represented by the court mages. So for best variety, and for access to higher-level spells, go buy spells from the College trainers.
3. College of Winterhold trainers will have _leveled_ lists, so you will only see them sell higher tier spells once you have leveled up the relevant school of magic enough to use the spells in question. So if you really want a higher level spell earlier, you may need to take alternate steps to get access to that spell, such as running Project AHO so that you can get access to the Typewriter.

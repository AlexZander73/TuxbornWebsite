This page is a collection of information you should know if you want to try to do any modifications to your Tuxborn installation. This is called a Rule 11 on the Discord, and if you do this, it will void your official dev support if anything goes wrong.

We will, however, provide this information to try to help you prevent anything going wrong. Please note these links for your reference.

* [Making your own NPC Merge](Making-your-own-NPC-Merge/): Ouroboros' advice on how to do an NPC merge, which may be necessary as part of modifying Tuxborn to your liking, or making your own load order

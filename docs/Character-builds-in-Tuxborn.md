This page is an overview of potential routes to follow if you're interested in a particular build type for your character in Tuxborn.

## Archer build

Since we are after all _running Skyrim_, the traditional Stealth Archer is of course an option in Tuxborn.

Some notable points of interest for aspiring archers:

* If you run Remiel as a follower, you can eventually get her to make you a custom crossbow.
* The Demon Slayer gear includes a bow, and its arrows are craftable (look for the Last Whisper arrow recipe).
* The Thane weapon for becoming Thane of Falkreath is a bow that has a chance of doing lightning damage to your targets. This would be a good early weapon for archers.
* The Bow of Shadows has a quest in the AE, but that quest is altered by Legacy of the Dragonborn, and it will therefore give you a Bow of Obfuscation instead. The enchantment on it will be the same as the AE Bow of Shadows, though.
* LOTD has its own version of the Bow of Shadows, which will not be available to you until you reach the tail end of the Shattered Legacy quest. You'll need to decide whether the Bow of Obfuscation or the Bow of Shadows is more useful to you.

## Battlemage build

Battlemages are essentially armored magic users. So a battlemage build could be a combo of Heavy Armor and Mage, possibly with an emphasis on using Destruction staves. As per information on what [Hand to Hand](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790) does to the Alteration tree, a potential battlemage build should include robes for the chest piece, and heavy armor on all other armor slots, to be able to take advantage of Mage Armor perks.

## Bard build

This isn't really enough to do a whole build on, but we're mentioning it here anyway as an option for a side way to round out your RP for your character: we're running [Skyrim's Got Talent](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50357). So if the idea of your Dragonborn being musically inclined appeals to you, then have a look at what that mod does.

## Gunslinger build

Tuxborn does in fact have some options for actual guns, so if you're interested in this, the first option for this opens up at level 20. You'll want to start running Wheels of Lull at that point, to get access to the harquebus weapons it includes. See [Mod overview: Wheels of Lull](Mod-overview:-Wheels-of-Lull/) for details.

Once you reach level 30, the Glenmoril vendor will spawn at the Roadside Ruins, and you will be able to buy additional guns from that vendor even if you haven't started Glenmoril yet. See [Mod overview: Glenmoril](Mod-overview:-Glenmoril/) for more on that.

## Heavy Armor build

Demon Slayer (see below under Undead hunter build) is the best contender for a Heavy Armor build. But since Heroes Rest Crypt is _not_ a good dungeon to tackle for lower level characters, you'll want to work your way up to this. See [Mod overview: Demon Slayer Armor Mashup](Mod-overview:-Demon-Slayer-Armor-Mashup/) for further details.

Other options for Heavy Armor to consider are:

* Legacy of the Dragonborn, once you found your Explorers Society, will have both Light and Heavy versions of the Explorers Guild armor. So the Heavy version could be good starter Heavy Armor until you're able to upgrade to something sturdier.
* Several Heavy Armor sets are available via [Immersive Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3479), and these should be craftable, as well as dropping as random loot on opponents you kill in combat. Review that mod to see what options it includes.

## Light Armor build

Points of interest for Light Armor builds:

* A couple of the craftable armor sets in Tuxborn should be of interest to players who want to do a Light Armor build: [Seasoned Traveller](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70222) and [Traveler's Armor Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93138). You can begin crafting these very early in your playthrough.
* Higher level Light Armor types may also be interested in the [Elmlock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105930) set, also craftable. 
* Legacy of the Dragonborn, once you found your Explorers Society, will have both Light and Heavy versions of the Explorers Guild armor. So the Light version could be good starter Heavy Armor until you're able to upgrade to something sturdier.

## Mage build

Tuxborn includes a lot more spells than vanilla, which offers a lot more to work with for anyone who wants to do a mage build. See [Spells available in Tuxborn](Spells-available-in-Tuxborn/) for an overview of all the new spells.

We also cover a bit about options for robes and staves on the [College of Winterhold](College-of-Winterhold/) page.

## Necromancer build

Some points of interest for potential necromancers:

* Even if you're not necessarily interested in the Demon Slayer armor and weapons, running Heroes Rest Crypt is of high interest to potential necromancers. The final loot for that dungeon _also_ includes a lot of Conjuration spells, including summoning of large groups of undead. See [Mod overview: Demon Slayer Armor Mashup](Mod-overview:-Demon-Slayer-Armor-Mashup/) for a list of those spells, and more info on the mod in general.
* Running a certain side quest in Project AHO can get you a perk that will triple how many summons you can have active at once. See [Mod overview: Project AHO](Mod-overview:-Project-AHO/) for further info.
* Necromancer players may want to review the spells and robes available via the [Necromantic Grimoire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Necromantic_Grimoire) AE Creation, and the [Gallows Hall](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gallows_Hall) player home.

## One-handed build

Points of interest for one-handed builds:

* The Seasoned Traveller gear set includes a craftable one-handed sword, which could be a good starter weapon.
* Silver Fang, the sword in the Demon Slayer gear set (see below), comes in two-handed form by default, but you can change it to a one-handed weapon at a forge if you prefer.
* When you become Thane of Whiterun, the sword Balgruuf gives you should come in either a one-handed or two-handed form. If you get the one-handed version, it could be a good starter weapon until you upgrade it to something better.
* You should review the weapons you are awarded by Auryen, as you fill out your displays in Legacy of the Dragonborn. Several of the weapons he gives you are of interest to one-handed builds, especially the Sword of Ancient Tongues, which you will receive from him when you have 550 displays.
* The Thane weapons for both Morthal and Windhelm can come in one-handed or two-handed forms.

## Spellsword build

Spellsword builds are essentially a combo of One-handed and Mage. Aspiring spellswords should review options for both of those build types, as described above.

## Two-handed build

Points of interest for two-handed builds:

* Even if you're playing a Heavy Armor build and may not necessarily want to use the armor, note that the Elmlock set includes a craftable greatsword. This has a better swing speed than vanilla greatswords, so it's worth keeping in mind.
* The Seasoned Traveller gear set includes a craftable two-handed sword. Like the one-handed version, this could be a good starter weapon.
* Silver Fang, the sword in the Demon Slayer gear set (see below), comes in two-handed form by default.
* When you become Thane of Whiterun, the Thane weapon Balgruuf gives you may come in either a one-handed or two-handed form. If you get the two-handed version, it could be a good starter weapon until you upgrade it to something better.
* If you acquire Daumbra via the [There is No Umbra](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89089) mod, this will make a bunch of extra perks available to you. More information on these perks is available at [this article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5201) on Nexus. Daumbra is a two-handed weapon, so players interested in playing a two-handed build should definitely check that mod out. Note also that since you can actually use Daumbra as a means to propel yourself, this could come in handy in certain parts of Legacy of the Dragonborn and Wheels of Lull.
* You should review the weapons you are awarded by Auryen, as you fill out your displays in Legacy of the Dragonborn. Several of the weapons he gives you are of interest to two-handed builds.
* The Thane weapons for both Morthal and Windhelm can come in one-handed and two-handed forms.

## Unarmed build

We're running the [Hand to Hand addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790) for Adamant, which adds an entire skill tree relevant to unarmed builds. If running a weaponless build sounds like fun, definitely read over what that mod does, to take best advantage of it.

Unarmed builds would also benefit from any of the Brawler gauntlets available via the AE's [Fearsome Fists](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fearsome_Fists) Creation.

Lastly, be on the lookout for any Rings of the Pugilist you may find as random loot.

## Undead hunter build

The [Demon Slayer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97731) armor available at the Heroes Rest Crypt dungeon would be an excellent choice for anyone wishing to do an undead hunter themed build. The armor is heavy armor, and while it comes designed for female characters by default, you can change this at any forge if you're playing a male Dragonborn.

Demon Slayer gives you extra defense against undead, and its weapons are silver, so they do extra undead damage.

The Thane weapon for Morthal deals additional damage to vampires, and increases your disease resistance.

## Vampire builds

If you want to run a vampire, have a look at [Playing a vampire in Tuxborn](Playing-a-vampire-in-Tuxborn/).

There are a few extra vampire-themed armor options in Tuxborn. Higher level vampire enemies will be wearing this gear, and you should also be able to craft it if you have Ebony Smithing unlocked.

## Werewolf or werebear builds

We're running multiple mods that impact playing a lycanthrope, and in particular, it is possible to play a werebear in our load order. Players who want to try this should look at [Playing a werewolf or werebear in Tuxborn](Playing-a-werewolf-or-werebear-in-Tuxborn/).

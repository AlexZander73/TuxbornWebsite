## "What is this mod about?"

First and foremost, Interesting NPCs does what it says on the tin: adds a whole lot of additional NPCs to the game. Some of them can be followers. Some of them are there to just provide you new quests, or even just new conversations you can engage in in places all over the Skyrim map.

The mod is not, however, limited to NPCs. It also adds a considerable number of new quests, new locations, and new custom items to the game.

## "How do I start Interesting NPCs?"

Given its very nature, you don't exactly start the mod as a whole. You'll find NPCs that it adds all over the place. If you see someone you don't recognize from vanilla Skyrim, try talking to them! You might pick up a new follower, or a new quest.

## "What level is recommended to begin Interesting NPCs?"

See previous. Unlike most of Tuxborn's content mods, that question isn't exactly relevant in this case.

Note, however, that some of the quests provided by Interesting NPCs may have their own individual requirements.

## "What followers are best to bring to Interesting NPCs?"

Again, not exactly a relevant question, due to the mod's very nature.

## "What should I bring to run Interesting NPCs?"

The willingness to engage with any unfamiliar NPCs you run into, pretty much.

## "Does Interesting NPCs have any displayable LOTD artifacts?"

Yes. We have an appropriate patch to add an [Interesting NPCs room](https://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.fandom.com/wiki/Interesting_NPCs_Room) to the Hall of Oddities. Consult that link, on the LOTD wiki, for more information on the items in question, since they're too numerous to list here.

## "What kinds of weapons and armor are available in Interesting NPCs?"

See link given in previous section. Most of the known weapons and armor items appear to be single named items you can display, as opposed to full gear sets you can use yourself.

## "Does Interesting NPCs have a player home?"

No. Not really part of what this mod sets out to do.

## "Are there any new followers in Interesting NPCs?"

Yes, a high number of them. All followers in Interesting NPCs should be using Skyrim's own original follower code, which has the following ramifications:

1. They should be safely manageable with UMF
2. They will count to UMF's limit of three total followers
3. They should auto-dismiss when you visit locations that don't allow followers to come with you
4. Serana should in theory be aware of them and expect you to dismiss them, when running Dawnguard

Additionally, Interesting NPCs classes its followers into "regular" and "super" categories. "Regular" followers are comparable in complexity and reaction lines to vanilla followers. Followers in the "super" category will be more complex characters and have more commentary, character development, and quests.

There are enough new followers available in this mod that listing them all here is not feasible. So for further information on the followers it offers, consult either of the following links:

* [Interesting NPCs](https://tes-mods.fandom.com/wiki/Interesting_NPCs) on the TES Mods wiki
* [Followers page](https://3dnpc.com/wiki/interesting-npcs/followers/) on the 3DNPCs wiki

So far amongst the Tuxborn playerbase, the most mentioned followers from this mod have been Zora Fair-Child and Rumarin, both of whom are classed as "super" followers.

### Info on specific followers

<details>
<summary><i>Overview of Gorr...</i></summary>
<br>

***
Gorr (not to be confused with [Follower overview: Gore](Follower-overview:-Gore/)) is a former arena fighter from Cyrodiil. Since he hangs out in Riverwood, this makes him one of the easiest followers to get in at the start of your game, assuming you go reasonably quickly to Riverwood.

Personality-wise, Gorr is not complex; his primary interests are food and killing bandits. Most of his random commentary orients around these two things, though this does mean he has at least one good remark about eating Alduin after you kill him. :D

He's most likely best used as a tank, as he's a heavy armor type, and his default gear includes a greatsword.

Since Gorr is easily findable in Riverwood, he's a good option for recruiting early in the game, especially for fighting Mirmulnir at the watchtower.

## "What custom items are available in Interesting NPCs?"

Known custom items are listed on the TES Mods wiki link in the previous section.

## "What quests are available in Interesting NPCs?"

The TES Mods link given above should have a full list of them, as does the [Quests](https://3dnpc.com/wiki/interesting-npcs/quests/) page on the 3DNPCs wiki.

For purposes of our load order, though, here's a quick reference table for where known Interesting NPCs quests can be picked up:

| Quest | How to launch |
| --- | --- |
| Birds of a Feather | Talk to Corpulus at the Winking Skeever to pick up an objective to go investigate Bird's Eye Tower. |
| Forgotten Lore | Talk to Olivia at the Arcanaeum at the College of Winterhold. |
| The Conspiracy of the 7000 Steps | Look for a Khajiit named Dar'rakki wandering around Ivarstead. Talking to him will launch his quest, which you might want to run at the same time as heading up to talk to the Greybeards. |
| The Paper Mirror | Talk to a miscellaneous Breton at the Winking Skeever, or read The Paper Mirror, Volume 1 in the cellar of Anise's Cabin. |
| The Teleportation Machine | Talk to the Argonian Two-Tails at Reachwind Eyrie. |
| The Way of the Nine | At Peak's Shade Tower, look inside the tower for the Khajiit NPC S'vashni. Recruiting Gore or running Shadows of One's Past via LOTD will give you good reason to visit this tower, so you can talk to S'vashni at the same time. |

## "What are some other recommendations for running Interesting NPCs?"

"Regular" tier followers may be good candidates to consider as Stewards for Hearthfire houses, or for Goldenhills Plantation.

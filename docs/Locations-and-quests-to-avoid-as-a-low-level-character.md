This page contains recommendations for things you should specifically _not do_ if you are a low level character.

## The Cemetery Homestead in Falkreath Hold

Just a bit to the west of Auri's Pod, there is a location called Cemetery Homestead. This location is where you kick off the Gravewind mod.

Characters under level 25 should _not_ enter this location yet, as Gravewind will lock you into its quest until you finish it. And that quest is _not_ recommended for levels lower than 25. Over 25 is better. See the [Mod overview: Gravewind](Mod-overview:-Gravewind/) page for more details.

So since Falkreath is a common area to visit as a low level character (e.g., if you're heading over to pick up the thaneship), be wary of that particular location until you're ready to tackle it.

## Clockwork

Clockwork auto-launches at level 5, with the NPC Isidor who'll attack you out of the blue and provide you with the initial pointer to launch Clockwork's quest.

However, doing so at that point is _not_ recommended. Clockwork will lock you into its plot once you launch it, and you will not be able to return to the main Skyrim worldspace until you're done with it. You should plan in advance for this. Build up a stock of supplies, especially if you're playing Survival Mode.

And advance your Smithing at least far enough to be able to craft Dwarven items. This will help you a _lot_ in Clockwork.

## Heroes Rest Crypt

The Demon Slayer gear is available in Heroes Rest Crypt, along with a sizable pile of spellbooks of interest to necromancers. However, we strongly recommend _not_ going in there too quickly. The mod creator recommends that you be at least level 20 before you attempt this dungeon.

However, we'll bump that recommendation up to 30, _especially_ if you're playing on a higher difficulty tier. Remember that Tuxborn is more difficult than regular Skyrim, so you should adjust expectations accordingly.

You may however pull off running this dungeon between levels 20-30 _if_ you are running a large follower squad, or are otherwise armed well to fight the undead. Weapons enchanted with Sun damage would be useful here, or spells that do Sun damage.

See [Mod overview: Demon Slayer Armor Mashup](Mod-overview:-Demon-Slayer-Armor-Mashup/) for more details.

## Moon and Star

Moon and Star can be launched as early as level 10. However, we recommend a later start on this mod, or at the very least, pacing your progress through it so that you finish it at a higher level. The final boss you'll fight in this mod would be very challenging for lower level characters.

Level 30 or higher would put you in a good position to take on Moon and Star's final boss.

## Project AHO

Our load order contains the patch that makes kicking off Project AHO a thing you can do at your own pace, by talking to the innkeeper in Kynesgrove.

Project AHO requires you to be at least level 15 to launch it. However, doing so under level 20 or so is still not recommended. Project AHO will lock you into it for most of its duration, although you will eventually reach a point where you'll be able to exit its worldspace and recover followers if you need to, before you finish the plot.

The major area you'll explore at the height of AHO's plot, however, will be extremely challenging for lower level characters. At least level 20 is recommended, if not higher.

## Tsatampra Xiros

This mod launches when you enter the Derelict Shanty near Solitude, and one of the very first things you do in there is fight a lurker. So entering the Shanty before you're able to take out a lurker is definitely _not_ recommended.

We recommend avoiding the Derelict Shanty until you're at least level 30.

## Wyrmstooth

Like Moon and Star, Wyrmstooth can be launched as early as level 10. However, characters at that level will probably find Wyrmstooth content a bit much. The mod _does_ give you four NPCs who'll help you in combat, in addition to whatever followers you may have already. This _does_ help your chances of survival. But if you'd rather actually kill Wyrmstooth opponents yourself rather than relying on your squad to do it for you, we recommend a bit more preparation. Mid-20's or higher for level should suit you well.

---

So far amongst the Tuxborn playerbase, Gore ranks very highly in popularity. He has rich characterization, a detailed backstory with several connecting quests to run, and high responsiveness both to general game events and to other followers.

## Where and when to recruit him

Recruiting Gore requires you ask the Falkreath innkeeper about a rumor about a disturbance in the area. Then you'll need to go to Peak's Shade Tower, where you'll need to run a short quest to save him from some Thalmor.

If you intend to run Gore _at all_, picking him up early in your playthrough is recommended. The reason for this is, if you pick him up several stages into the main quest, you will get his reaction lines to _those_ events first, rather than the initial lines you should get from him when you first encounter him. So it's best to get him early on, before his code gets confused as to which lines to give you first.

### If you don't actually want to run Gore...

... then you should avoid taking the relevant dialogue option with the Falkreath innkeeper. As long as you don't take that dialogue option, this should keep Gore from spawning.

Alternately, it is in fact possible to kill him on your very first encounter with him, while he's still in the bear trap! (For some players, this may be a feature, not a bug. 🤣)

## How to summon him

Gore has a dialogue option you can take regarding getting separated, which will set up a Summon Gore power for you.

## Best follower use

He's definitely best used as a heavy armor/two-handed weapons tank, although he'll use a bow if you give him one.

## Level of commentary to you

He's one of the most talkative followers in Tuxborn's available set, with a whole lot of lyrical commentary about Skyrim's environment in particular. While this does a great job at showing that Gore is surprisingly poetic-minded for a dude whose name is "Gore", he doesn't seem to have a way to adjust how often he makes random commentary. So be prepared for him to talk a lot if you run him.

He'll react to your working at crafting stations, such as the alchemy and enchanting tables.

He'll also react to your status in combat, and will yell for you to stand back and drink a healing potion if he sees your health get too low, and let him wallop on your enemies instead.

## Level of commentary about main quest, side quests, factions, and mods

Gore responds to main quest events, and will even periodically show up at certain checkpoints in the main quest, even if he's not actively following you at the time. This is by design, as per his creator.

He's also responsive to side quests. If he is following you when you run Cidhna Mine, he _will_ port in there with you, and additionally behave as if he's been thrown into the mine alongside you.

He'll react to your entering cities and faction locales such as the College of Winterhold and the Bards College.

He has _very_ strong reactions to the House of Horrors plot in Markarth, and he will rage-quit following you if you join the Dark Brotherhood.

And he is one of two of our custom followers compatible with running Vigilant. (The other being Auri.) If you choose to run that mod, plan your timing of when to run it cautiously, not only in general (because Vigilant is best run as end-game content), but also specifically if you have Gore as a follower. Vigilant is known to cause Gore significant trauma, so be mindful of this if you take him into that mod!

## Level of commentary with other followers

He has splendid commentary with Auri and Remiel. With Remiel in particular, he even has a running subplot involving Remiel teaching him to read, which is fun to watch play out.

## Some important notes

### Known character flaws

While Gore is a very well-developed character, he also has certain known character flaws which may or may not be dealbreakers for you if you choose to run him.

<details>
<summary>Known problematic Gore behavior...</summary>
<ol>
<li>He has misogynist commentary about the women in Solitude.
<li>If you are running him with Remiel, there is a scene between the two of them that can trigger if they both follow you into a shop. It involves Remiel trying to buy corundum ore, and blanking on what it's actually called. Gore tries to help her out, but his idea of "help" involves being abusive to whatever shopkeeper is involved. So if this bothers you, and you want to run him and Remiel anyway, just make sure not to take them both into any shop.
<li>He's also insulting to Angeline in the alchemy shop in Solitude. He's snide about the shop name.
<li>He has a habit of calling each and every opponent he faces in combat "freaks", whether they are bandits, draugr, necromancers, creatures, Daedra, or whatever.
</ol>
</details>

It is worth noting, however, that even his more problematic behaviors are intentional on the part of his creator.

As per a blurb from his page on Nexus:

> "This mod touches on some personal subjects that may upset you. His personal quests are optional, and you can avoid any of this by not pursuing them. I am not a writer, I was blessed with the gift of drawing on my own experiences to shape his story, meaning it was a bit easier for me to make him believable. That being said, I am not Gore. Gore is not me. He is not a self-insert, but rather a vessel meant to convey a message that victims should not be expected to be perfect people. I drew inspiration from my experience as a veteran, a CSA survivor, and other shitty experiences that shaped my life, but I also drew from Eden's experiences as well as others. Despite the heavy themes, this is a story of healing, kinship, and blood. the metaphorical kind, specifically. Chosen family, and its validity. This mod was for trans people first and foremost. It's for people whose family has let them down. It's a story about finding that acceptance and love with your chosen kin, and it's a story about finding happiness."

### "Gorpse" curse

There is a known bug with Gore that happens only under certain circumstances in which he's killed while following you--and his corpse will spawn somewhere near you every time you change cells, after.

This is known to reproduce under the following circumstances:

* Eating him as part of running Namira's questline, "The Taste of Death"
* Battling him to the death as part of Boethiah's questline, "Boethiah's Calling"

As of yet it is not confirmed if it will reproduce under these circumstances:

* Killing him while he's in the bear trap on your initial encounter
* Killing him with the Ebony Blade
* Killing him during a certain specific mod, as well as his own personal quest (see following)

<details>
<summary>Spoilers on how else Gore can die...</summary>
<ul>
<li>There are known points at which Gore can die while you play through Vigilant
<li>There is also a point in Gore's personal quest line where you might have to fight him to the death depending on what choices you make
</ul>
</details>

Gore is usually set Essential, so most players probably won't run into this bug unless you trigger the above circumstances. So for example, it's probably not likely that he'd die just as a result of friendly fire from you in combat, or from any other follower you're running.

Regardless of how you might see it, if you _do_ trigger this bug, this isn't a Tuxborn-specific thing.
